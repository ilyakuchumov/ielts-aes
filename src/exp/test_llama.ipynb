Furthermore, the growing demand for food and industry also contributes to the increased demand for fresh water.

    "Nowadays, our life improved by technology developments. Although some people think that communication through computers and mobile phones increased and has a detrimental effect on how young generation develop their skills in reading and writing, others think that this impact of technology is not a disadvantage. I strongly belive that young people reading and writing skills have suffered due to increasing usage of computers and mobile phones.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, technology  increases day by day and we have to be aware of what is new and implement it on our everyday life. It is certainly known that communication through online platforms it is more easier than the usual one and currently it is vital to have at least one tool like mobile phone or computer if someone wants to have an online conversation with somebody else. A survey was conducted on young subjects in 2007, in the United Kingdom and almost 90% of their respondents agreed with the fact that communication using devices is easier and more effective than using traditional ways and they looked more willing to use a device, like a digital book rather than have similar reading like in the previous generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add more, there are many situations which provide that communication using only devices can be deficitary and it involves a lot of disadvantages. First and foremost, young generation can not experience the biggest pleasure of reading a new book, feeling the fragrance of their pages while sitting at the desk. Also, from the primary school, children learn how to effectively write and this situation needs improvement every day, because currently during the classes, many children get distracted and try to avoid what is vital for a society: to know how to correctly write. What is more, it has been proven that writing on a device decrease the rate of concentration in left emisphere of the brain and ought to this issue, many health problems can appear and develop. Nevertheless, technology development is an insurmontable situation that can not be stopped. During the years 2010-2020, a study was made using foreign students from my University and the results shown that those who used devices like mobile phones or computers in order to communicate had a lower rate of learning our mother tongue than others who concentrated on traditional books. Furthermore, a long period of time looking at blue screens affected the visual content and therefore most of them needed to see an Ophtalmologist.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, it is evident that communication is the most striking feature in our everyday life and both traditional and digital paths can be used, but younger generation needs to be aware of the disadvantages of using most of the time only devices like computers and mobile phones, because the drawbacks can outweigh more than the positive effects.\n",

While some may argue that technology has improved communication, I firmly believe that the benefits of traditional methods far outweigh the advantages of digital communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, the rise of digital communication has led to a decline in face-to-face interactions, which are essential for developing reading and writing skills. In the past, people would engage in conversations, debates, and discussions, which helped to improve their language skills. However, with the increasing use of computers and mobile phones, people are spending more time interacting with screens than with each other. This has resulted in a decline in the ability to read and write effectively, as well as a decrease in the ability to think critically and express oneself in writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the use of digital devices for communication has also led to a decrease in the quality of writing. When people write on digital devices, they often rely on auto-correct and spell-check features, which can lead to a lack of attention to detail and a decrease in the quality of writing. Moreover, the use of digital devices can also lead to a decrease in the ability to think critically and express oneself in writing, as people are often limited to using pre-written phrases and sentences.\n",

      "Thirdly, the use of digital devices for communication has also had a negative impact on the development of reading skills. With the rise of digital media, people are spending more time watching videos and listening to podcasts than reading books. This has resulted in a decline in the ability to read and understand complex texts, as well as a decrease in the ability to think critically and analyze information.\n",

This essay will discuss the causes of the increased demand and propose solutions to address this issue.\\n\\nThe overpopulation of the world's population is one of the primary reasons for the rising demand for fresh water. With the increasing population, the demand for food and other essential resources also rises, leading to a greater need for water. Governments and individuals can take measures to address this issue, such as investing in new technologies that can reuse water from soil and agricultural waste.\\n\\nAnother significant factor contributing to the increased demand for fresh water is the growing use of water for industrial and agricultural purposes. The lack of modern infrastructure and machines in many farms leads to significant water waste, resulting in a substantial loss of this precious resource. To address this issue, governments can invest in creating food in laboratories, which would reduce the need for water in agriculture.\\n\\nGlobal warming also poses a significant threat to the availability of fresh water. Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns lead to droughts and water scarcity, exacerbating the issue. International cooperation is essential to address this problem, and governments and individuals can work together to reduce environmental degradation, avoid deforestation, and increase the use of renewable energy.\\n\\nIn addition to these measures, educating children and students about the importance of water conservation is crucial. By teaching them how to save water in their daily lives, we can encourage them to adopt sustainable practices and reduce their water usage. This can have a significant impact when combined with other measures to address the global water crisis.\\n\\nIn conclusion, addressing the global water crisis requires a multi-faceted approach that involves governments, individuals, and international cooperation. By investing in new technologies, creating food in laboratories, reducing environmental degradation, and educating children and students about water conservation, we can work towards finding solutions to this pressing issue.\"}]\n"
