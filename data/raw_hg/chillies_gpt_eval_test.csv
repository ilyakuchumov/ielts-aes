"Interview form the basic selection criteria for most large companies. However, some people think that interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ and there are better methods. To what extent to you agree or disagree?","To agree or disagree with the statement that interviews are the basic filteration criteria is an important issue. Putting the discussion in a wider context, interviews has always been debatable. Even though some people think that there are better methods for employing a resource rather than interviews , I wholeheartedly believe that interview is a good method for recruiting candidates. First I will discuss some arguments supporting my ideas about this statement, after which some aspects against that will be presented.

 On the one hand, many people agree with this statement for many noteworthy reasons. The most remarkable is that the recruiters can get an idea about the personalitty and skills of the potential employees .For instance,when the person is asked about any topic and he answers it in a concise and crisp manner,then the recruiter gets to know he is suitable for the job. Another key reason is that if a candidate is asked about case studies then the recruiters can judge the personality traits of that employee and also the ability to think outside the box.

On the other hand, other people disagree with this statement for many reasons. They believe that other modes of recruiting like written tests and group discussions will help understand the mindset in a better manner.Written tests help in evaluating the technical or theoretical knowlege of a person.

Group discussions help in getting a grasp of the conversational skills that he/she possesses.For example,in sales and marketing jobs conversational skills play a major role.  

 All in all, when all the specific reasons and relevant examples are considered and evaluated,  I strongly  agree with the idea supporting this statement because its benefits outweigh its drawbacks.","**Task Achievement (6.5)**

The increase in the production of consumer consumption goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this and what can be done to solve this problem?,"It is true that the rise in consumer production has detrimental impacts on the natural environment. This essay will discuss the causes behind the environmental damage and propose potential solutions to mitigate these consequences.

There are two primary reasons why the increase in consumer goods manufacturing poses a threat to the natural environment. Firstly, the extraction of natural resources leads to devastating ecosystem disruption. Consumer goods production heavily relies on the extraction of minerals, fossil fuels, and timber, resulting in habitat destruction, deforestation, and the depletion of non-renewable resources. For example, the widespread demand for electronic devices has led to increased mining activities, contributing to ecological disruption and soil erosion. Additionally, the logging industry for furniture production has resulted in intensive deforestation, causing a loss of biodiversity. Secondly, the energy-intensive manufacturing processes and transportation used for goods delivery account for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, pushing the Earth towards a climate crisis.

To tackle these consequences, several measures can be implemented. The first solution is to encourage companies to adopt sustainable sourcing practices to ensure responsible extraction of resources and minimize habitat destruction. For instance, enterprises can prioritize the use of recycled materials and promote sustainable forestry practices, such as tree replanting initiatives. Furthermore, investing in research and development of alternative materials with lower environmental impacts, such as biodegradable plastics, and renewable energy technologies can help reduce the reliance on scarce resources. The second solution involves governments offering incentives, such as providing tax deductions and implementing regulations, to encourage industries to transition to renewable energy sources, improve energy efficiency in manufacturing processes, and adopt greener approaches.

In conclusion, various measures can be taken to address the environmental issues caused by the growth of consumer goods manufacturing. To achieve better results in environmental protection in the future, companies need to be fully aware of the negative impacts and adopt appropriate sustainable practices, with oversight and support from governments. By implementing these measures, we can work towards a more sustainable future and mitigate the detrimental effects of consumer production on the natural environment.","**Task Achievement:**

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"It is widely argued that the growth of the number of factories producing customer products has a negative impact on various aspects of the natural habitat. The essay attempts to shed light on the driving factors behind this negative view before outlining several viable solutions that should be adopted to tackle the mentioned problem. 

There are two primary reasons why some individuals often consider the production of consumer goods as a cause of many serious issues in the natural habitat. One reason is, it often starts from the origin of products that serve people's daily needs. We can name a lot of goods such as food, drinks, pencils, paper, clothes, or electronics. They are mass-produced to meet human needs, so large firms are needed to resolve this problem. Of course, it is quite difficult to build large-scale factories in the city, on the contrary, they are built in the countryside, leading to many consequences for the surrounding areas. A large number of trees were cut down to give way to new factories, reducing the area of forest cover significantly. In addition, their waste that is not properly treated will harm the soil and water habitat, affecting aquatic or underground ecosystems. Another reason is that some customer merchandise is produced with natural ingredients. For instance, paper is made of wood, and dishes are made of sand. The ensure them to mass production leads to the over-exploitation of these resources, leading to the risk of imbalance in the natural ecosystem.

To combat this worrying concern, the following feasible steps should be taken. First and foremost, the unquestionable impacts of production companies on the surrounding areas should be promoted widely through official media. As a result, local residents could be able to be aware of the economic benefits that also affect the environment which manufacturing firms play in their lives, thereby making them change their oppositional or acceptable attitudes towards these companies. Furthermore, governing bodies should enforce strict regulations on these commodities manufacturing industries. For example, they could impose heavy fines on those littering or polluting the local environment to these manufacturing firms, which could protect the local environment from being contaminated by the irresponsible behaviour of these enterprises.

In conclusion, there are some underlying motives behind this negative perception towards the industry of consumer products, and it is crucial that the aforementioned measures be implemented to change this oppositional perspective.","**Task Achievement:**

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"The production of new items and objects have been a well discussed topic recently in our society. Many people explain that the growth of world economy has brought harmful effect in the atmosphere. Nonetheless, others argue that it is necessary the creation of new goods as well as services. In this essay, I am going to analize the issue of new things, and at the end, I will give possible solutions of these problems.

On one hand, undoubtedly, it is a reality that new goods have helped to increase the air pollution. For example: In the last years, the population has been increasing dramatically. Therefore, we need more products in order to conservate the life quality. As result, we demand more services and items such as clothes, cars, and food thus we produce more pollution along with garbage.

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"In recent years, an increase in the manufacture of consumer goods has been seen. While this is connected to population growth, it has resulted in an increase in a detrimental effect to the environment. In this essay I will look at 2 possible causes for this as well as suggest some solutions. 

Due to the extreme high volumes of manufacturers in order to meet the increasing demand of products, there has been an increase in factory produced CO2 gases. This is because the manufacturing processes have not become more efficient as quantities have risen. In China for example, many new factories have sprung up over the last few decades resulting in huge quantities of pollution being fed into the air. If factories were to spend funding on researching more efficient manufacturing processes, the amount of polluted air would be decreased. Manufacturers in their numbers, should concentrate on reducing CO2 production. 

With the increase of factory workers, there has been a matching increase in the transportation of these workers to the facilities. In addition to this, there is an obvious rise in the transportation of products, all of which has resulted in higher Carbon gas emissions form vehicles involved in the process. The number of busses and trucks carrying labourers to and products from the factories in China have added to the already polluted atmosphere in the country. Improved and more efficient vehicles using no fossil fuels, such as in electric vehicles, or less fuel will improve this situation. Transportation accounts for a large percentage of the worlds total carbon gas production.

While it is understandable that we need more manufacturing facilities for the ever-increasing world population, we need factories who take environmental issues seriously. Factory management need to ask themselves the question, ""are we doing enough to minimize our carbon footprint?","**Task Achievement: 3.5**

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"The natural environment is harmed as a result of increased consumer goods manufacturing. The main reason for this is that the products which involve chemical materials are harmful to the environment and a viable solution is to make strict laws to protect the environment. 

First of all, one of the first problems of that the number of people consuming increases year after year, and some of them consume more than they need. In the other words, when people consume more products, they become product more goods. In addition, all manufacturers want to meet the demands of their consumers. As more goods are produced, toxic wastes are released from factories into nature. For example, more single-use products are introduced, most of which are non-biodegradable.  These products can remain as waste for thousands of years,  turning our planet into a huge landfill.

A solution that is some measures should be taken by the government. Manufacturers also  should be encouraged to use eco-friendlier materials. For example, the WWF which is a famous brand in Turkey has recently replaced nylon and polyester clothes with reusable alternatives made of materials like cotton or wool. Thus, the clothes which are produced by WWF can be recycled.  

To conclude, the major problem of damage to the natural environment caused by the excessive consumption of products can be partly alleviated by making laws. Furthermore, it is predictable that the number of factories which use eco-friendly materials will increase over time. . . .  . . .  . . .  .","### Task Achievement: 7

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the cause of this ? what can be done to solve this problem.,"t is maintained by some that students execute better when in a single-gender school, compared to a co-educational environment. However, in my opinion enrolling children in a mixed school is of utmost importance as it prepares them for the real world.

To begin with, co-educational institutes allow pupils to develop their team working and interpersonal skills. Teamwork provides ample opportunities for the students to interact and work together, which is completely lacking in single-sex schools. This can have a positive impact as at the present competitive market, employers are keener to hire individuals who can incorporate team spirit and social skills. In other words, when both the genders are able to communicate effectively and comfortably to achieve a task together, they have better career prospects in the future.

Another point to consider is that children are able to acquire a deeper understanding of the opposite gender and their views. As boys and girls have a different outlook on life, they can learn and benefit from each other in a coeducational setting. For instance, students assigned to work on a group project, can see aspects from a different angle and perspective, which results in a more positive outcome.

Finally, being taught together encourages competition between genders, which can often give rise to better results. In a competitive learning environment, students are more driven to succeed and surpass one another to achieve the desires outcomes. The majority of boys in co-educational schools perform better academically compared to the ones in same-sex schools, due to the fear of bad grades and feeling inferior in front of their female counterparts.

In conclusion, I believe mixed schools are better for the youngsters in the long run, particularly career-wise as it mirrors the real world much more closely than single gender schools.","## Task Achievement:

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"There has been a rise in producing consumer products, which leads to harmful impacts on the natural environment. While there are some reasons why this trend happens, several solutions can be taken to solve this problem.

To begin with, this tendency happens due to a number of reasons. The first one is that the more products people manufacture, the more trash such as defective items people throw at the nature, especially the aquatic habitat. This would result in water or air pollution. Additionally, in order to get necessary materials such as wood for the manufacturing process, businesses’ owners normally have to gain them by exploiting from the environment, which could lead to deforestation or soil erosion. For example, the Son Tung logging company used to cut trees a lot, which led to the biggest flood ever recorded in the history of Vietnam.

Fortunately, several measures can be done to deal with this issue. Firstly, entrepreneurs can apply technological developments to recycle trash, so that, these trash can be used again and again. By following this idea, enterprises can reduce the regularity of leaving trash in the nature. Secondly, the government should apply some laws against exploiting natural resources. For example, if I keep illegally deforesting the Amazon rainforest despite not being allowed to do it, I might result in  permanently being in jail as a punishment or even being put to death penalty.

The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"In the last few decades, our society has witnessed the rise of the industrial revolution around the world, which in turn leads to the excessive mass production of goods growing beyond consumer demand. As a social and economic phenomena, it has had several impacts on the natural world and the living conditions of humankind. In this essay, I will discuss the main causes that give rise to the overproduction of goods and offer some measures to tackle this problem.
The root of an excessive supply of products lies within the evolution of human society itself. Among many possible reasons that cause the glut of goods, consumerism is considered to be the main culprit. Because of the belief that certain merchandise do not hold the same value anymore when it is out of style, in tandem with the ever-increasing appearance of advertisement in every household, modern citizens are convinced to believe that they must stay up to date with the ongoing trends by purchasing new products even though their old ones still function well. Recent researches have shown that today’s people have the tendency to buy the newest and the most fashionable smartphone models in the marketplace, despise the fact that their current mobile phone is not out of date yet. Another trend of human society that has helped create the excess of supply is the planned obsolescence. Modern companies intentionally design their products to be out of use after a short span of time such as clothes, shoes or smartphone batteries and thus force the costumers to come back to buy new ones. As a result, the two above reasons encourage people to keep buying unnecessarily new merchandise and therefore start the chain of overproduction. In the end, for the industrial production requires different resources which come from the natural world, the oversupply will eventually lead to environmental degradation, for example the unrestrained development of pulp and paper industry will lead to deforestation or the overfishing of seafood industry will result in the loss of marine life.
In response to solve this increasing adverse effect, some viable solutions must put forward. Firstly, the government should implement a law to ban manufacturers to plan the failure of their goods and encourage them to produce more durable products, so consumers do not have to replace their bought products too frequently. Secondly, the media should promote environmental programs that raise awareness of overconsumption and overproduction. For example, a tv program that shows the harmful effects of excessive unsustainable production on ecosystem health will inspire people to buy less and not contribute to the oversupply of goods. Once the buyers are aware of how their shopping habit can have serious impacts on the environment and decide to end this toxic practice, the excess of supply will not be a problem anymore.
In conclusion, it must be said that the overabundance of products is a contentious topic with no easy answers. However, in my mind, the most effective solutions would be to encourage the consumers to do shopping responsibly by not buying goods for unnecessary trends. It is not unrealistic to expect that raising consumers’ awareness will help reduce the increase of producing goods in the impending future.","**Task Achievement:**

Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Education is the key to becoming successful in life, however, most of the students find it difficult to concentrate on studying at school. Although they feel distracted, there are a lot of courses that students need to cover, and I will discuss possible solutions for improving their concentration in the upcoming paragraphs. 

Firstly, the main reason that the students are unable to attention to study is that they feel fear because of the extra syllabus as they feel they are unable to finish on time. For instance, most learners prefer to complete topics which are easy as otherwise they feel a stress on mind to finish it. Secondly, children love to spend time on the internet where they play video games up to late at night which is the main distraction as they are unable to get proper sleep due to which they have lack of energy to focus on their studies. 

The prominent solution for improving the curiosity of students towards their studies is that they make proper time for sleep which helps for the proper functioning of the brain. Elders have to make strict rules regarding the playing time of the kids so they get enough time to complete the homework as well as get time to revise class work.  

To conclude, children want to play video games most of the time which is the main cause that they do not like studying, whereas, their parents should make strict rules to limit their play time so they can focus better on education.","**Task Achievement:**

Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"It is true that many children find it difficult to focus on the course at school. There are many reasons behind this phenomenon, so we need to take a comprehensive approach to mitigate it.

On the one hand, several factors contribute to this aissue. One of the reasons is the development of technology such as the applications of smartphones. With smartphones, many students are addicted to the virtual world brought about by mobile games and gain a sense of achievement

, which cannot be found in schools. The influence of the environment is another main reason. For example, if the juveniles around them behave badly in schools like talking to others or sleeping in classes without being punished by teachers, which may have a bad impact on them and they may imitate this behaviour, leading to their lack of focus on their school work.

However, many measures can be taken to solve this problem. To begin with, parents can take children to do some outdoor activities such as kite flying and hiking. They are good ways for juveniles to get close to nature and be away from the virtual world. Then the children may understand the beauty of the real world. Furthermore, improving teaching quality is also important, which means teachers can make their teaching content more abundant to increase the opportunity for interaction with students. For instance, teachers should introduce more entertaining activities in classes such as brainstorming and group discussions. By doing so, the minors can focus more on the course at schools.

In conclusion, the development of technology and the influence of the environment are the main reasons why it is difficult for students to catch the course at school, but actions should be taken along several aspects through doing outdoor activities and heightening teaching quality.","### Task Achievement:

Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to their studies in school. What are the reasons?

   From my prespective, there are number of reasons leading to pupils' loss of concentration during classes. the first cause would be domestic troubles, minors are very sensitive to instabilities, divorces, any of the parents absence, violence, financial problems, under nutrition, malnutrition, or unstable daily schedule resulting in lack of suitable sleeping hours, study time, and enough period to play and have fun so Juniors can release their energy.

  The other factors are schoold related, starting with schooling system which doesn't consider what type of sciences the kids are attracted too, some loves art, the others prefers biology, and others are fond with history, also the educational techniques and materials that in many cases are boring and forces any one to fall a sleep.

"Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to school. 
What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?","Education plays a pivotal role in children’s developmental years, and the quality of which requires the dedication of both students and teachers. Unfortunately, it is found that children in schools are not engrossed in study. Does this mean that teachers are unqualified or are students themselves to blame? What are the remedies to overcome this problem?
Adolescents’ innate characteristics should be brought into close scrutiny. Children, as non-grownups, are generally less self-disciplined. This means that they are ofttimes unable to control their concentration, easily affected by distractions such as a sudden sound or an idea that pops up and is unrelated with the class.  Each time students get sidetracked, they would miss the important points that teachers are elaborating. To combat this productivity-damaging weakness, there should be more research on strengthening children’s concentration. The ability to focus on important tasks for a longer duration of time could keep students from absent-mindedness and boost learning efficiency.
Another cause of this problem is attributed to ineffective teaching. These days, many teachers are not doing a good job. They constantly adopt teacher-centred methods in class, without taking into account students’ preferences.  This inappropriate method could demotivate students, making them lose interest in study. The solution would be to opt for a student-centred attitude. Teachers could integrate into their class livelier and more inspiring elements, so that the classes they teach would be more in line with young people’s taste.  With an intense interest in what the teachers are saying, the students would voluntarily engross themselves in these absorbing topics.
In summary, adolescents’ shortcoming in self-discipline and the mechanical teaching strategy chosen by teachers are held accountable for pupils’ inability to focus on study. The suggested recipes are to enhance those young people’s concentration and to put a higher value on what they are fond of.","### Task Achievement:

"Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, most people are more wealthy than in the past, which provide a better quality of lifestyle. However, it is argued that the extra income would not provide extra satisfaction. Personally, I agree with this stance, and the following content will outline the reasons.

Firstly, the function of money could lead to happiness. To have enough money, people have no need to have a busy and exhausted lives for earning money, meanwhile, they are also rescued from the financial pressure, such as house rent or bills. As a result, after obtaining enough money for living, people already satisfied, a higher amount is not essensial for their prosperity.

In addition, extra income could lead to extra payment. A higher salary means workers should pay more taxes from thier income to the country. For example, some people will buy luxuries when they become wealthy, which need to pay the tax about luxurious products.

Furthermore, money does not represent happiness, in contrast, people should learn how to be satisfied from the items they already have. While earning more money, people can have more choices, some of them could be whelmed when they make the decision, nevertheless, more options could also be a problem because people could have more than they need. For instance, accumulated items at home, keep buying luxuries and becomes greedy without satisfy, which will have a negative impact on the family financial and also children's concept of spending money.

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In the last few years climate change is a common topic of discussion. Different organisations are trying to convince the soicety, that climate change is a problem, that can lead to fatal end. However, some people believe, that we should not try to prevent climate change, but to find a way to live with it.

Climate change is not a myth, but it is something that is happening right now. The volatility of temperatures is the best example for that. In Bulgaria summer is becoming longer and hotter. Climate change has a very negative impact on environment - forests are being destroyed because of fires, animals are dying because of change in their habitat, glaciers are melting. But all of this leads to other problems. For instance, because of the absence of enough trees, air will become even more polluted. Furthermore, more health issues connected with our lungs will occur.

On the contrary, some people tend to believe, that we should not fight against the climate change, but to work with it and to accept it. Thus, they think, that this is natural outcome and nature knows what is best for it. In the last decade some revolutionary discoveries were made and scientists believe, that life on Mars is possible, therefore people are not worried about climate change, knowing that we will be able to move to other planet, if our disappears.

In conclusion, I believe that climate change is a really big danger and we should try to save our planet Earth from it. I don't see why we should give up from it just because other options may be available. The fact is, that life ends with our death, but Earth continues to exist and we should keep that so.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people suggest that seeking a way to go along with climate change outweigh preventation of it. I oppose this view and believe we should take bolder action towards it.

First and foremost, climate change is detremental. Researches and studies have proved that climage change will lead to detroy for human civilasation. The escalating increase of temperatures which conbribute to glaciers melting and sea level rising will sink seashores and islands underwater and  force people to emigrate and lose inhabitable lands. Similarly, extreme weather which has become more frequent and common is causing floods, land sliding and droughts.  For example, deforestation due to needs for human inhabitaion is further deteriorating air quality and escalating pollution. Consequently, there will be no place for us to survive.

However, despite the impractical idea of living with it, climate change is still reversable. In the past decades, goverments have set up goals and aim for the target to keep temperature rise under 2 degree. If we could keep carbon underground by eliminating fossil fuel usage and planting trees, the nature circle could regain its resilience and sustainability. In fact, people have been living with gradual climate change for years and realised more drastic and pregmatic. Fostering the transition of renewable engery and sustanable food system by stoping the fuding of high-polluting industy and fishing are strongly appealled for.

In conclusion, I believe intervention is a better measure to protect our environment and keep it inhabitable for hunam being. Thus, both the goverment and individuals should work togrther to achieve the goals.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people think that instead of preventing the climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","A section of the society believes that in spite of putting a stop to environmental crises, they think to adjust to the change. I unequivocally disagree with such an opinion because it will cause several health issues in people and it will also increase the temperature.

The first reason for my disagreement is that climate emergency will make people ill. It generally occurs due to the toxic gases released in the air such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and helium, breathing such harmful substances makes a person suffer multifarious health issues. Moreover, it decreases the life span of an individual because of not getting sufficient oxygen. For example, a recent article in Times Now revealed that 27 per cent of people leaving in urban areas suffer Lung dysfunction at their early age. 

The further reason is that global warming is a life-threatening problem. The rise in temperature  is a menace to the vegetables growing, as a ,result there will be very little food available for the individuals. Further, the meltdown of glaciers will raise the sea level, and many islands will soon be drowned in water.

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?


Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","It is argued that society should not take measures in order to curb the degradation of the environment and instead need to accept the situation. Having accumulated a variety of solutions to tackle climate change, speaking personally, I advocate this statement because we still do not get any significant results, and it is a total waste of global budget. 

To commence, although numerous implementations in decreasing levels of emissions, that contribute to climate change, were made, global society witnesses no critical drop in them. Thus, these ecological decisions may be onsidered as inaccurate money expenses, and therefore could be spent in more beneficial ways. To exemplify, wind electricity plants that have been erected in suburbs of the capital of Kazakhstan required roughly 500 million dollars that set  confusion among residents. It has been claimed that this national money could be spent on subsidizing less advantageous spheres such as farming and oil industry. 

Despite the aforementioned argument, it is claimed that if we will find a way to live with the current climate change, people would be less stressed. In the present, increasingly more incidents about people's occurring depression about global depletion of the environment. Society would be more mentally stable if they accept the fact of it.  For example, if an individual is afraid of how he could prevent environmental issue, he will be more stress inclined; however, it will be easier to live if he will just live with it.

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Climate change is one of the most essential topics in today’s world. Accordingly, there are many approaches in order to solve this major problem. While there are some people who consider climate change as something that can be lived with, others give it extreme importance and look for powerful solutions for its prevention. I strongly believe that this severe issue is something to be dealt with. For that reason, we must take individual actions and force governments to act in accordance with necessary precautions.

First and foremost, I must state that raising awareness and commencing individual action constitutes the most effective part considering the prevention of the alterations in the climate. Specifically, individual action forms a cumulative organization due to its nature. To illustrate, decreasing the frequency of using automobiles and aircraft makes a considerable difference in terms of the continuing process of climate change. Clearly, it provides low waste of gas which spreads to the air. 

Second, after taking individual action, people must cajole governments into taking relevant measures for the elimination of possible outcomes of this matter. Furthermore, all around the world, governments are initiating and managing investments with a plethora of other governments or private companies in order to maintain economic development. However, the irresponsible behaviour of politicians in monetary terms harms the future of young generations. Therefore, to exemplify, people must force governments not to make investments in fossil fuel and sectors that cause high carbon emissions.

In conclusion, the tendency of living with climate change and not trying to stop its negative effects in the environment should never be the policy of any country. We absolutely cannot just live with it. Instead, everybody must comply with the rules and regulations set forth under respected institutions and non-governmental organizations for avoiding the consequences of it. By taking individual steps and pressuring governments, we can get positive results and leave a clean and viable earth for the next generations.","**Task Achievement: [6]**

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extend do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, due to proliferating globalization dramatic climate change is observed on the earth which represents a major threat to life on this planet. However, some folks think that they should accept this change rather than stopping it. In my opinion, I completely disagree with this opinion.

Firstly, we should create awareness among the people to grow more and more trees. Consequently, this lush green beauty helps in controlling the increasing temperature on the earth. As trees are considered to be the best absorbent of hazardous carbon dioxide gas. For example, countries covered with the healthy green environment are merely prone to the climatic change.

Secondly, the government should step forward and make some stringent rules to lower down the pollution emitted from the vehicle as well as from the factories. As this pollution is depleting our ozone layer which directly impacts the climate. Furthermore, this layer is responsible for saving our planet from the heat of the sun. Thus, use of electric vehicles and alternative fuels should be encouraged to deal with climate change. For instance, people of countries like the Netherlands after adopting electric technology are enjoying the salubrious and pleasant climate. 

If instead of taking the above measures we simply continue to live with the climate change the consequence will be disastrous. Natural resources like water and more should start depleting due to change changes in the climate. Additionally, frequent flood will be noticed in the low lying areas due to rising temperature. Hence it causes many pernicious diseases. So living with the problem of climatic change will be hazardous for to the people.

In conclusion, I assert that we should take the above measures to prevent this situation of climate change rather than living with it and make planet earth a beautiful heaven to live.","**Task Achievement: (7)**

"Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Climate change represents a major threat to life on Earth, but some people argue that we need to accept it rather than try to stop it. I completely disagree with this opinion, because I believe that we still have time to tackle this issue and reduce the human impact on the Earth's climate.

There are various measures that governments and individuals could take to prevent, or at least mitigate, climate change. Governments could introduce laws to limit the carbon dioxide emissions that lead to global warming. They could impose “green taxes” on drivers, airline companies and other polluters, and they could invest in renewable energy production from solar, wind or water power. As individuals, we should also try to limit our contribution to climate change, by becoming more energy efficient, by flying less, and by using bicycles and public transport. Furthermore, the public can affect the actions of governments by voting for politicians who propose to tackle climate change, rather than for those who would prefer to ignore it.

If instead of taking the above measures we simply try to live with climate change, I believe that the consequences will be disastrous. To give just one example, I am not optimistic that we would be able to cope with even a small rise in sea levels. Millions of people would be displaced by flooding, particularly in countries that do not have the means to safeguard low-lying areas. These people would lose their homes and their jobs, and they would be forced to migrate to nearby cities or perhaps to other countries. The potential for human suffering would be huge, and it is likely that we would see outbreaks of disease and famine, as well as increased homelessness and poverty.

In conclusion, it is clear to me that we must address the problem of climate change, and I disagree with those who argue that we can find ways to live with it.","### Task Achievement:

"Money should be spent on creating new public buildings such as museums or town halls rather than renovating the existing ones.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is believed that money ought to be disbursed on forming new public settings, for instance, museums and town halls as distinct from the renovation process of the current buildings. In my opinion, the public finance should be allocated to both the renovation and the creation of cultural areas as they are valuable assets of a city independently of the mode of existence. 

Governments should pay attention to conserve historical museums, regional areas or other buildings, as they are vital for a country to attract tourists. Some of them are successfully doing it through restorative methods. Conversely, others who do not have any remnants of historical places are obliged to create new ones. Take for instance, the United Arab Emirates are constructing hundreds of buildings every year to develop its nation culturally, and thus it is one of the most visited country in its region. 

European countries have many renovated museums and halls, and this gives a feeling as you were in a time tunnel. However, newly constructed buildings are also successful at transmitting the ancient texture of that city to visitors. In terms of costs, the renovation can be by far more expensive than the construction of a new one, yet rich countries will overcome this problem easily. 

In conclusion, public settings play an important role in the cultural development of the nation, and thus they are highly preferred tourist attractions. I believe that, money should be spent on both of them. Rich countries may allot more funds for the restoration, while poor ones have to focus on building these with spending the least amount as possible.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people think the money spent on developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people are of the opinion that the fund which is used to explore the universe should be spent on more practical sectors instead. While I concur that the ambition of studying outer space is justifiable, I believe that the government should use this amount of money for other purposes which bring more benefit to citizens.

On the first hand, for decades, it is undeniable that the growth of humanity has been mostly based on people's curiosity, which makes exploring celestial bodies more necessary to keep pace with the world's development. Firstly, the technology for aerospace investigation is one of the methods which has triggered people to reach certain achievements. For instance, scientists carry out many studies in the labs located on other planets to find more resources to provide to the earth's life. Besides, the experiments on the universe distinctly bring some benefits in the future such as broadening knowledge about interactions between planets, then people can predict upcoming disasters due to out-of-the-earth factors.

On the other hand, it is apparent why many are in favour of allocating the money which is for space exploration on more advantageous aspects. The most conspicuous reason is that humans in recent years have faced many problems, particularly, environmental degradation and severe transmitted diseases. In detail, the environmental concerns are more and more significant because there has been no practical measure to tackle factory waste and emission. Otherwise, owing to the budget shortage, not everyone around the world is accessible to medical services which have been a burden to the healthcare system. Meanwhile, beyond-Earth research requires a large amount of money which can be used in finding proper solutions for those existing problems.

In view of the arguments outlined above, I conclude that although getting to know about the cosmos is important, improving current problems is more a priority to society. All things considered, from my perspective, space exploration is not a proper way to use the government subsidy in this situation.","## Task Achievement: [8.0]

"Some people believe that they should be able to keep all the money they earn, and should not have to pay tax to the state.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued by many individuals that there shouldn't be any taxes on their hard-earned money as they don't get many facilities from the government. This essay partially disagrees with this notion as the government need money to run the system. 

To begin with, It is really painful to share our hard-earned money with the state when we don't get any direct benefits for the same. Additionally, people felt cheated when they need to pay the taxes on their every purchase when they have already paid the taxes on their income. Moreover, the system doesn't provide any financial security to them in case of any mishappening. For example, recently millions of people in India lose their job due to the Covid- 19 pandemic but none of them get any financial benefits from the state. 

However, I partially disagree with this viewpoint as we all received many indirect benefits from the government such as infrastructure, subsidies fuels, hospitals, schools and universities. Moreover, they provide a secure environment to us with the help of police and other forces. Additionally, the state runs many schemes in which poor people get subsidies food from the state. For example, Food Corporation of India has purchased 80 million ton of wheat and rice in 2019 and they have distributed this to the people who are below the poverty line.

I disagree with this statement as these taxes bring many advantages to society and the country.

On the one hand, a huge number of individuals believe that their earned amount must be used for their own benefits, such as living expenses, utility bills, school fees, cars, and others. Also, they believe to invest in long-term or short-term plans for saving purposes as a result, they use that amount to improve their living standards. However, the masses avoid paying income tax regularly. For instance, according to a recent survey conducted by the government of Pakistan, which reveals that around 60% of the population did not pay the income tax in 2019.

On the other hand, the government takes taxes for many reasons. First and foremost, medical insurance, which is free of cost for any citizen of the country in Pakistan. Also, there is a massive discount available on medicines from the insurance company. Secondly, the government spends millions of rupees to improve the infrastructure of the country, such as road construction, railways, airports, shopping malls, and others. Last but not the least, the government pays off debts from these amounts.

To sum up, the government takes these tax amounts to improve its economy and fosters numerous benefits to the local community. It is a national duty of every resident to pay a small portion of their income to the government for their own advantage.","**Task Achievement:** 7.5

"Some people believe that they should be able to keep all the money they earn and should not have to pay tax to the state. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","People work tirelessly throughout their lives to earn money. However, a major portion of their income is lost in the form of taxes. It is argued by some that the hard-earned money should be retained by the people, rather than paying a portion to the government in the form of taxes. I completely disagree with the above-mentioned statement and believe that it is entirely necessary to contribute to the government in the form of taxes. 

To begin with, some people are wary of contributing a part of their salary. Instead, they prefer to use the money for their own needs. Money is everything in today’s world and is used to buy most of the amenities including food, clothing and shelter. People need money for the good upbringing of their children and to have a healthy lifestyle. In addition, people also need money to invest and secure for their future. Also, certain rich or developed nation doesn’t tax their people. For instance, people working in certain Gulf countries are not obliged to pay taxes. Thus, people from certain sections of the society have apprehensions about paying taxes. 

However, the idea that people should not pay taxes is completely preposterous. Nevertheless, there are several reasons which states why citizens should oblige to pay. For the state to function efficiently and effectively it needs funds at its disposal, which is usually collected by the government in the form of taxes. Administration, defence and infrastructure development are all responsibilities of the government. These services are of utmost importance and would eventually prove to be advantageous for the people of the country, as this money would return to them in some form of service. Moreover, it is the responsibility of the individual to contribute to the social and economic progress of the country. 

To conclude, people advocating to the prospect that they should not be taxed have a flawed understanding about the topic. The ramifications of not paying taxes will have adverse impacts on the economy and the services which the government provides to the people.","**Task Achievement:** 7

In conclusion, even if the public's image of services and goods may seriously affect the level of their consumption, and many people might be persuaded to buy and use them, there are still ways to sever such an influence by educating potential customers and providing more information about what is being sold.","### Task Achievement:

Besides, misunderstanding about products is  one of the results of getting numerous  advertisements, because of competition between companies.

Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?,"It is crucial to consider the impact that many advertisements from different business competitors have on their customers. This essay will explore some of the issues which have resulted from this effect and propose some measures that might address them.

Firstly, one concern about using advertising is that people are tricked into buying things that are not necessary for them. This is because they are enticed to catch up with the latest trends, especially from celebrities they have been following. As a result, people squander their hard-earned money, which should have been poured into their long-term financial investments, on extravagant commodities. To tackle this issue, governments should educate their people about the essence of living below their means. In doing so, people will ensure not only do they have a wealthy and perennial future, but they also contribute to reducing waste.

Secondly, another significant issue associated with advertisements is the risk of misled harmful products. The reason for this is that, nowadays, there are a lot of companies which merely chase their benefits recklessly. These businesses try to get their customers to buy their products as much as possible without considering the future repercussions that may occur, which is a real danger in the context of medical supplies. For instance, people could perish due to misusing drugs, but televisions and newspapers today are saturated with abundant strength-boosting pills. This problem could be mitigated by tightening the advertisement regulations to ensure many noxious ads are filtered before they reach end customers. 

In conclusion, advertisements from competing businesses have created two problems which are extravagance and detrimental products. However, these issues could be minimized if governments invest effort in improving citizens’ knowledge and stiffening advertising regulations.","**Task Achievement (8)**

"Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies.
To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements?
What measures can be taken to protect them?","In recent years, there are more and more businesses which make an abundance of advertisements to compete with their counterparts. I believe this kind of situation has contributed to some detrimental impacts on customers. This essay is going to introduce some solutions to affix this problem.   

For one thing, the increasing number of advertisements certainly make people feel annoyed when they are watching their favourite TV program, every time the culmination is about to come, advertisements will pop out and interrupt the TV program. For another thing, some advertisements will not provide people with correct information, so they will be misled and waste money buying something that does not live up to their expectations. For the last thing, the worst situation is that some ill-intentioned businesses will use advertisements to scam others and make them fall into a financial predicament.

In order to deal with this problem, the government should introduce some legislation against it. For example, the government can ask all companies to reveal all the information about the products transparently, so that customers will not be cheated. In addition, people should cultivate the ability of media literacy to help them distinguish some exaggerated and misleading advertisements. Therefore, if companies violate the regulations and keep offering advertisements which will confuse customers, people can protect themselves and boycott the products made by them. 

In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, although advertisements cause some inimical effects on people's lives, we still can prevent some negative influences from happening and make the world a better place.","**Task Achievement: 6.5**

Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.,"There is a subject of controversy whether workers should put aside while working for their retirement or depend on pensions that they receive from the government. Both of these views will be discussed in this essay.
On the one hand, some people believe the government is responsible for pensions. Workers are considered as a crucial factor to determine one nation's success because they have devoted themselves to working as well as to the betterment of society. Hence, after retiring, they have a right to be provided with finance. For instance, in Vietnam, medical students spend over 6 years in university and keep on getting higher medical qualifications, then they are always on the run in the hospital while working to help patients and reduce the mean mortality rate. With these contributions, they deserve to receive financial support while retiring.
On the other hand, putting by on their own has some benefits. This could lessen the financial burden on government and more state budget will be used for improving other life aspects such as poverty in remote areas or education for the underprivileged. Moreover, having independent savings enable old people to be more active in having a well-fed life as well as let their offsprings not be worried about them. With savings, retired workers could pursue their own hobbies and improve their spiritual life such as fishing with old friends or treated themselves a vacation.

"Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. 

What is your opinion?","People have different opinions when it comes to providing financial support and attention to elderly people after retirement. While some people believe governments are accountable for assisting these individuals, others argue that individuals should plan their retirement ahead of time. However, in my opinion, governments could provide better support to the senior citizens of their country.

In the past, most families supported their parents and grandparents during their old age, which is a fact that is changing in today's world. Now, more and more people try to avoid giving any support to their elders and this trend has been growing day by day. In this case, governments should make some effort to subsidize the cost of living for these old aged people, who could not earn money because of their higher age; furthermore, housing for the aged can be built at the cost of tax money, which could at least provide a comfortable shelter to these people. Consequently, senior citizens will not suffer due to poverty or homelessness.

Undoubtedly, it is a good idea that people should also plan their retirement ahead of time to avoid suffering at a later age. However, it would be extremely difficult for people who earn a lesser income every month to save some money for their future. Even though a large sum of money could be saved for this purpose, no amount of money could assure a sustainable life. Governments could play an important role here to implement some saving systems which could make life easier for elderly people. Consequently, this will benefit senior citizens to live a happy life.","**Task Achievement: 6**

Do you agree or disagree?","Financial support is one of the important needs for graduates and postgraduates in other to fulfil their research. However, some people claim that the government should only financially promote scientific investigation rather than other subjects. In my ,opinion I totally  agree with the statement because science contributes to the evolution of the world . 

To begin, the knowledge industry requires a lot of attention and financial support because they are the most important corporations in the world .Furthermore, they contribute to the survival of species and the well-being of humans as well as animals . For instance , in the year ,2020 the whole world faced the COVID-19 pandemic which had an impact on the nation. Each country, especially  Europe had to financially hold up the scientists to supply a vaccine. This actually helps them to provide us in this year 2021 with a different type of  vaccine that is helping the community to fight against the virus.

In addition, investing in postgraduate scientists is supporting the medical and technology research department for a better and easier future way of life . This is the best way for the government to improve the knowledge industries to fight against future problems and also upgrade our lives. For example, our way of communicating has been boosted for the past 10 years with the hold-up of science. We can be connected at all times, working from a long distance and also being in touch with one family at every moment of the day . Thus , it is much easier to communicate and facilitate our conversation.

"Money offered for post graduate research is limited; as a consequence ,some people argue that financial support from the government should onlg be provided for scientific research rather than research for less useful subjects.Do you agree or disagree","Due to limited availability of funds foe higher education it is often recommended that financial assistance should be offered to scientific research instead of allocating funds to supplementary subjects.This notion should be accepted as many facts in favour of practical sibjects could be considered.Certainly the major argument in the favour of subsidising science and technology is rooted in the fact that advancement in science and technology not only reflects the prosperity of the  nations but also vouchsafes the other domains .To illustrate it can be said that investments in scientific research  including diagnostic and curative measure ensure the sound health of its people.Secondly it also paves a way towards the holistic development of a country by facilitating innovations and discoveries .

Another compelling reason might  be due to unreservedly salience of science in terms of boosting the economy and living standards of the country.

However one might argue that the importancd of supplementary subjects such as economics and statistics should not be neglected as it assists the nation in policy formation and analysing the currend situation.Thereforce an equal proportion of the financial assistant is required for these areas.

Some people believe that the government should continuously support the development of arts. Others believe that the money can be well spent on scientific research. Discuss both and give your own opinion.,"The individual thinks it is better to set a budget to support  art  in front of it, but some people believed that  it must spend on scientific research to improve our scientific and cultural knowledge. In my view spending money on the scientific area is more necessary and vital for many reasons like the lack of knowledge we have to win this competition from all other countries.

First of all spending money on art and entertainment is really good to support our artists and I believed that even it can be a good encouragement to born new masterpiece. For instance, annual money support can be an awesome incentive for painters or singers etc. The fact that helping them in their way,  can improve the art industry.

On the other hand, some groups of people believed that it is much better to spend money on scientific investigation and experiments. For example, if  government organizations spend some budget on climate change, they can find many ways faster and much easier to protect the world in front of many dangerous circumstances. Due to many problems in the world like  lack of food, lack of a place for inhabitants, climate change, increasing prices and many other problems it would be better to invest in science, we can even save the world and many people's life with these kinds of research.

To sum up, investing in scientific research is my cup of tea, in my opinion saving  people's life or the world's future at the hand of scientists are hundred precent more important than art. Artists can bring and make incomes and improve their sales by advertising and they can spend money on the development of art but researchers can't spend a lot of money to learn how to save people's life.","**Task Achievement:**

"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","It is true that we live in a world today where humans are well known for their appearances rather than their achievements and some argue that this will have a bad outcome on our kids. This essay totally agrees with this statement; I believe that they are setting a very bad example for the youth.

First of all, teenagers are looking for a role model to follow their steps in real life, and by looking up to influencers, it can result in terrible consequences due to the fact that these celebrities don't actually preach about hard work but only glamour lifestyle; therefore, kids will be under the impression that this what success looks like, as a result, they'll try to imitate that rather than work. Moreover, by seeing how they are dressed, youngsters will tend to copy them by buying expensive clothes that they are not able to afford; thus, demanding extra cash from their parents that will be an extra burden on their shoulders. for example, a survey done in a shopping centre in London showed that most young individuals visit expensive stores more than others.

Secondly, with the rise of social media, anyone can practically become famous, even by doing the stupidest things ever, and these individuals will surely be a bad role model for our kids, for instance, in Tiktok, users can get well known by only dancing. Furthermore, children will no longer be motivated to continue their studies whether in school or afterwards in university after seeing by doing the minimum effort they can be famous and get paid through Apps and be able to travel across the world and eat every kind of food.

To conclude, for the reasons mentioned above, I believe that celebrities are a bad example for our children.","**Task Achievement: [6]**

"nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement.","Many famous people are well-known for their glamour and rich instead of their achievements in society; thus, some people would argue that it could make a negative effect on the youth generation. This essay completely agrees with the statement above because of toxic things like smoking and sometimes they could extend the wrong information affecting teenagers’ life.

 

First and foremost, well-known people could affect negatively the young generations through their lifestyles. It means that some humans could follow their favourite superstars to tattoo  their faces or use illicit drugs when they are inspired by their idols through social media. For example, many teenagers have a trend to use drugs like vape, cocaine, and alcohol when they see their famous singers and celebrities using them on live streams without thinking about the effects.

Furthermore, numerous celebrities can lead to misunderstanding among the youth generation. That is to say, some famous humans didn’t focus on their studies, but they were still successful, and it also means that their fans could unexpectedly raise awareness of the wrong information that they can also be wealthy without studying. For instance, Bill Gates mentioned this problem in his speech many years ago about how he felt regret when he expanded the wrong knowledge about studying in an unexpected way that he’s a billionaire, even dropping out of school.

In conclusion, some well-known people could affect children in an unexpected or expected way because of their wealth and lifestyle instead of their contributions in life. I strongly agree about this statement because the spreading of the Internet could follow with many potential risks like illegal drugs and wrong information from superstars.","**Task Achievement**:

"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","These days, the thriving development of communication allows famous figures to reach audiences and inspire them. However, it is believed that at the moment, these household names should not become role models to current generations because money and glamor are foundation of this fame instead of achievements. From my perspective, this opinion is true to certain extent and I will explain my preference in the following paragraph.

Perhaps for many, this option is quite convincing because of several reasons. First, a significant number of celebrities are famous because of their talent and attainments. To be specific, civilians, who have an unfortunate background, attempt to work hard and make efforts to acquire achievements. Particularly, household names, who have actual talent, should become a good example for youngsters to follow. For instance, in Vietnam, Ha Anh Tuan is famous because of not only his excellent voice but also his integrity. Second, products or items, which famous individuals utilize, are bought by their fans. To elaborate, thereby, famous figures assist in promoting brands’ benefits. 

However, these arguments are insufficient to overshadow the drawback of the  topic in question. First and foremost, at the moment, the current generations’ standard to define the success of a citizen is inadequate. In particular, an individual, who just need the beauty and wealth, could prevail easily. Worst still, some civilians are popular because of their notorious actions. In addition, scandals are often more visual among junior citizens and this encourages them to follow. In fact, in Vietnam, an inordinate number of tiktok users posted ludicrous videos and encouraged children emulate them. 

In short, celebrities who reach specific attainments in their career should become role models for youngsters to emulate and KOLs also help brands to increase their benefits. Nonetheless, because standard of junior citizens to determine the success of a household name weak, so notorious civilians also gain grounds and this is a bad example for children.","### Task Achievement:

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the contemporary era, media persons are well-known for their fashion style and property rather than their accomplishments. It may create a negative impact on the young generation. I do not fully support the above statement. In the forthcoming paragraph, I will discuss my thoughts.

Firstly, the general people follow  celebrities in their daily life, and also consider them as their icons. So, it is normal that they have a huge effect on the common folk. At present, celebrities are more concerned about their lifestyle. They try to be in limelight, hence they are keeping themselves fit. For that reason, they are going to the gym for exercise, and maintain healthy food habits. Even though they get aged, they look so young. the community can gain inspiration from their idols as well as can lead a healthy and glamorous life. Secondly, in the ,world everyone works hard for earning money. If someone is recognized by his or her wealth, it will not create a bad impression on the young. Consequently, others will try to earn money by following them. For instance, if someone's favourite actor or actress wears a dress, it will influence others to earn money and buy the dress.

Alternatively, I am not denying, being famous only for their luxurious life and wealth will not influence

the Z-gen fully positive away. the nation also should focus on its achievements, so that it can work hard and achieve success like its icon.

society will only remember them for their work. The young generation is getting up-to-date by

following the lifestyle of  celebrities.","**Task Achievement: 6.5**

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Mankind has wanted to have expensive life since its creation. There is a new phenomenon that being rich and having luxury life draws people's attention more than their success ,unfortunately it dramatically affects youngsters badly. I opine, that sort of tendency will kill  creativity and push people to earn easy money instead of working hard to gain an appropriate salary.

    To begin with, people do not prefer to work in order to have luxury life instead of an intense schedule they are looking for the easy way. Even if they are successful when they have reached the high standard of living, they stop working on it. By doing so, it would kill their creativity and their quality performance. For instance, Hakan Kurt, who had been playing in the Goztepe football club from 2002 to 2005, was the most popular athlete in Turkey. Much big football teams had desired to transfer him. However, after he had gotten good fortune, he  finished his football life.

    On the other hand, today’s world has constituted many lazy individuals with that case. Nobody desire to be a labour. Since they are thinking that they would be able to earn a fortune effortlessly. That fact has  increased among  young people, nowadays. Therefore big amount of employers have difficulties finding an employee. This results in a decrease in companies production capacity. because young people take a pattern the celebrity's life standard. for example my cousine Ahmet his biggest dream is to be a singer, but he does not want to work a regular job.

    to sum up, famous people's possessions and lifestyles have the wrong effect on youngsters. They are trying to have an easy fortune rather than gaining it while they are working.

To What extent do you agree or disagree?","The current generation of famous personalities are known more for their attractive lifestyle and less for hardwork which I believe is misleading the youngsters. I will explain in this essay how the focus on extravagant lifestyle of a celebrity instead of focusing on their work can leave a wrong impression on the youth.

 Firstly, the living style adapted by the well known people sets unrealistic goals and standards for an average person. Moreover, the importance is given to the looks and style of clothes rather than the succesful art which also results in people spending unnecessary money on expensive beauty and health products. The youngsters try to look like these stars by using overpriced materialistic things and hence, loose their focus on studies and their career. There are multiple online websites that sells the exact clothes used by the celebrities with an astonishing price range. With such standards a young person gets influenced easily and lead a misguided life.

 Secondly, the overshow of the luxurious way of life of a famous personality leads the people to beleive that the hardwork is the least imprortant part of their success. Their talent and artistic work is overshadowed by their media presence. As we all know, the social media has been an intimate medium to get an access to a celebrities life which is mostly deceiving. Although, the purpose of these stars is to motivate people but they end up leaving a bad example of putting the glam above the job.

"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth rather than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.

To What extent do you agree or disagree?","These day’s youngsters are influenced by renowned personalities’ fame and fortune rather than their accomplishments. I completely agree younger generation is influenced by the charisma and prosperity of superstars rather than their attainment. The essay is going to elaborate on how these celebrities influence juveniles badly.

The youth follows these famed personalities blindly and try to spend lavishly on their looks and lifestyle. Moreover, the possession of luxurious cars and expensive clothing’s boasts of their financial strength leading to provoke the youth for spending excessively. This results in an excessive financial burden on parents as these youngsters are not financially self-dependent.  For example, in my ,locality there is a group of growing kids who imitates Justin Bieber and buy costly Justin Bieber merchandise without checking their financial strength.

Secondly, these youngsters being obsessed with the fame of these luminary being unaware of hard work and hardship, blindly adopt a lifestyle at times and risk their health and sometimes life as well. It is observed that in many colleges a number of students imitate the stunts, big shots of smoking a cigar, intake of drugs and alcohol etc. as they see them in movies and end up with accidents and spoiling of their lungs.

Considering the above examples it is clear that youth follow fame remaining unaware of the hard work and accomplishments of these trendsetters. For these ,immature it is important to be in trend rather than analysing rationally what is right or wrong for themselves. So according to ,me I agree to a large extent that these 21st-century generations focus on  fame and prosperity rather than accomplishments achieved by these showmen’s.","## Task Achievement:

"Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth rather than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people.
To What extent do you agree or disagree?","In this modern era, high profile people are becoming popular with the masses just because of their alluring and charismatic personality. The crowd starts following their idols blindly which in turn plays havoc with their own persona and sets a wrong precedence for the coming generation.. This essay will discuss about the unnecessary hype of money and upper class status  without knowing the harmful effects on society and I strongly support this opinion.

In present scenario, actors have indulged themselves into wrong activities like smoking, drinking and partying late night. They have a misconception that they can do anything in the name of celebrity status and with their money power. Supporting different looks and enticing the innocent people with their display of money has become a trend nowdays. Most of us know that Salman Khan had killed people on footpath while he was drunk and later on he got saved because of his status and money.

In this era, what we see is what we believe. Our young generation is taking our industry people as their role models. They have devalued our traditional cultures and respect for their elders that is why young ones are also arguing with their parents. These famous people must behave in a responsible manner towards the society. The yesteryear actors were so much dedicated towards their roles and how they  impact their generation in positive manner.

"Some think that governments should support retired people financially while others believe they should take care of themselves.


Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Retired people have been increasing in numbers, nowadays. This stage of life is believed to be given support financially by the government, however, there are others who think that they need to finance their needs and should not expect any government assistance. Both of these views need to be discussed further as I believed that these retired individuals are important members of the society and should be given support from authorities for as long as they need them. 


Many of the retired people are receiving pensiones from their previous work in different sectors that offered insurance policy. This financial support sometimes comes from the government’s insurance system if they had worked for the government sector such as public teachers, soldiers, and other government office employees. In this regard, it is axiomatic that the government should support retired people because they had rendered service for a period of time.


Meanwhile, there are retired people who were not able to establish financial security at their old age. These are the ones who worked menial jobs, or unfit to work at all. In this case, there are government authorities who make sure that these individuals are taken care of under a social service unit. Rendering care to these people is a government responsibility in order to build a humane society. 


However, a part of the society is not keen on the idea of government helping the retired ones. This is due to the fact that some of them are still physically and mentally able to work. Others also claim that their families, especially children should take responsibility for financing their needs. For instance, in Filipino culture, the elderly are well supported by their family members and some children even include them in their paid insurances, such as medical care. 


All these being said, the government needs to allocate budget for social services to retired persons who do not have any support from private sectors or their own families. These retired members of the society have rendered in their own way a service to their nation and thus should be respected and supported in their needs.","## Task Achievement:

"A lot of old people are suffering from loneliness these days. They also lack physical fitness.

What do you think are the reasons for this problem?

Can you think of possible solutions?","Nowadays, a significant number of old people are becoming looner, they do not have physical activities as well. In this essay, I will describe the ongoing reasons for this issue and address the possible solutions. 

First, we cannot ignore the consequences of social media, the human being as a result of progress in technology  becoming depressed and  other mental health problems. Therefore, old generations do not want have any physical activities as they compare themselves to influencers on Instagram, They also suffer from loneliness as most children leave their parents and have their own life  . For instance, sadly,  old society in Iran has been suffering from being alone more than ever as most of the occasions their children went  abroad. One solution for this matter is to participate in the majority of classes. Thus, they have less time for spending on social media and thinking of their children. 

Second,  one of the vital stuff which makes us who we are is our habits, things we are used to doing.  Accordingly, many things we do when we are old are stuff we have done in  the past in our youth time. As an illustration, young people rather than playing outdoor games prefer to play online and this seriously harms their bodies and minds. So, old generations should make physical exercise and socialise with other people their habits when they are young.  This can be done by warning teenagers at schools to have these activities a part of their lives to not suffer in the future.

A lot of old people suffering from loneliness these days. They also lack physical fitness. What are the reasons for these? Can you think of possible solutions?,"Nowadays, it is irrefutable that the life expectancy of old generations is getting shorter ,However they are not physically fit and prefer to live alone. Although there are some researches that have been carried out, resulting some solutions and its causes. that will be articulated in upcoming paragraphs.

initiating with the causes. The predominant reason is an environment to elaborate, in this modern era. Although there are some technologies that have been introduced to us, by which health problems can be cured, it causes a massive amount of damage to the environment, which makes older people hard to survive it cause some critical illnesses to them. Moreover, their physical strength also becomes weak and resulting some people may suffer from serious problems like paralyse. Secondly, Families are getting more attentive towards their work, whereas Children are busy in their schooling, by that, they do not get enough time, which they can use to talk with their older parents. Resulting in them suffering from loneliness and they become introverts. For example, 40% of individuals live separate from older people, as they feel hard to take care of them and the remaining 60% of Individuals are favoring their work more rather than their elders. Thus, they feel alone and also become physically and mentally weak.

Despite the aforementioned causes, there are some solutions to tackle them. Firstly, the government has constructed some parks away from polluted areas. by planting trees ,especially for old generations in which they can do some physical exercise in the arms of nature, resulting to enhance their immune system as well as increase their life expectancy. Another solution is those old people can find the same masses with whom they can talk or play. Moreover, working people and youngsters should give them time to talk about their past activities and supervise them. For instance, Recently, authorities have announced a law. Elders can register the file against people who try to torture them, resulting 10,000 dollars fine with 3 years of jail.

"The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem.




To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Metropolitan cities face a severe shortage of accommodation  leading to declining health and rising crimes.,Apparently the issue can be tackled  only by a government intervention either by putting a limit on on the entry of new people into cities or by expanding the urban region.The public contribution is limited in solving the issue as  the root cause of the shortage of land remains unresolved. 

 

Since the basic issue lies in the lack of space for building houses,the community has a limited role in executing a long-term solution.Temporarily,they may resolve shortage by sharing homes or residing in the countryside and travelling daily for jobs.The former solution can result in poor  health due to overcrowding and lack of adequate basic facilities while the latter would cause mental stress to those commuting long distances daily.Both these would affect the productivity of these people in their jobs.

The government can make a marked change in this situation by restricting the entry for new residents as that can give more time to solve the current housing issues.Then the administration should ensure that the population is proportionate to the land available and take measures to sustainably build adequate housing apartments.An alternative solution wud be by subsuming nearby farmland or expanding the outskirts of cities so as to provide the required amount of land for building suburbs.

 

In conclusion,I believe that the housing shortage in metropolia can be effectively solved by the government either by having a practical ratio of citizens with land or by expanding the land to build new residences.City folks have a limited role as they can only adapt to the available accommodation though it is with great difficulty.","**Task Achievement:**

The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences .Only government action can solve this problem .To what extent do you agree or disagree,"Accommodation is an essential need in our lives. The scarcity of shelter can cause serious problems. Some people believe that it is the state's responsibility to solve the shelter shortage. The government can act by creating affordable housing trusts , introducing new home zones and giving incentives to small builders. I completely agree that it is solely the authority's responsibility to solve shelter deficits in cities.

The creation of affordable housing trusts aids by giving people mortgages to buy apartments that can be paid over a certain timeline. Building more apartments and giving loans help to mitigate the problems of housing in towns. For example, an apartment can accommodate a tremendously higher number of individuals than a house which occupies and wastes land. Furthermore, the government can introduce new home zones in virgin lands which are nearby the metropolitan. This is done to empower individuals who want to build houses and are unable to purchase land or apartments in the city. As a result, it helps to decongest the number of people in towns and provides solutions to housing problems.

Also, the government should give incentives to small contractors to enter the market of constructing houses as independent builders. Likewise, this helps people who are unable to afford professional builders to build their homes. In doing so the authority will be increasing the number of houses for its citizens.

In conclusion ,I believe that it is the state's main responsibility to curb the lack of homes in the metropolitan area by providing several measures to accommodate its citizens.","**Task Achievement:**

Only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Housing scarcity is thorny a social issue every government needs to resolve.  After all, over-high 

housing price exerts a detrimental influence on people’s happiness index. Some people argue that only the government can relieve the pressure of housing because the most supreme governmental administration. Personally speaking, governments do have a vital role to play in stabilizing the housing price, but there are still other means to tackle this severe problem.  

Indeed, I have to concede that governments can， in more ways than one，  restrain the ever-accelerated cost of new houses . One of the most effective ways to control over the expenditure of the house is to deter the greedy speculators or property developers from flipping homes, more precisely， the vacancy rate could be greatly reduced when governmental interruption works. 

Moreover, governments are supposed to strengthen the supervision over real estate developers so that it helps to stop those illicit merchants from disrupting the regular economic orders. However, the effort made by home buyers and builders is indispensable. 

As far as wealthy house purchaser who desires to earn high interests in housing investment concerned, they should learn to eliminate their avarice for an enormous house. The rich had better assume the responsibility to set a fine example for society.  In this way,  the public will learn that housing investment is not the only worthwhile way to allocate wealth. In the meanwhile, ordinary buyers not only ought to work diligently to raise money for future house investment, but also make full use of the government policies and bank loans to promote the standard of living. 

Furthermore, the builders’ efforts cannot be ignored. Firstly, they ought to transfer their housing strategy from building luxurious villas to popularizing economically affordable houses. Only when cheaper houses are built by property developer can they meet the demands of common house consumers. Similarly, mass media have the duty to alter people’s mode of thinking in house via 

encouraging people to rent houses if they cannot own their property in short time.

"The housing shortage in big cities can cause severe social consequences. Some people think only government action can solve this problem. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?","These days as the population is increasing at an unprecedented pace, the housing shortage has become one of the main consequences. It is concerned whether it is an obligation of the government to alleviate this issue or whether the nation is responsible for the lack of accommodation. I firmly believe that both parties should integrate and contribute to the solutions. 

To begin with, there is ample evidence that sustainable housing is strongly due to government regulations. That is to say, political houses should establish certain restrictions on the numbers of people and land that is distributed to each citizen. For instance, a recent survey has revealed that 25 countries had a scarcity of land to construct new houses because of the fact that government didn't allocate the land properly and residents were prone to build large houses in order to outperform one another, which later caused housing shortages in multifold metropolitan cities. 

Secondly, it is explicit that because of the nation's unprofitable purchase of lands and housing facilities, it has become prevalent to some citizens to inevitably live in flats and accommodations. It can be solved by public organisations that can share and divide some houses, which indicates that the government is not fully liable for such an issue. For example, several cities concluded that this problem is partly due to people's actions, 45 per cent of which could solve this problem by uniting both the government and the nation. 

To conclude, it can be clearly seen that I strongly advocate that it is not only feasible for the government to come up with a solution, but also citizens of the city are able to resolve the scarcity of housing.","**Task Achievement:**

Only government action can solve housing shortages in big cities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some people believe that only legislation isable to encounter the problem of housing management in major cities. In my view, both public and authorities can find out solutions collaboratively. 

To begin with, the government has tthe authorityity to enact  large-scale change; they can be made a decision by designi  an urban organisation. For example, Singapore, they have been encountered the housing crisis and solved it by vertically building such as high-rise buildings with the proper layout. Moreover, me civil work such as hihighwaysor mmotorways might be eliminated by using underground construction where passengers can easily accessible through the subway as well as reduce traffic congestion.These abovementioned could h the residence shortage by building vertical construction.

Furthermore, the government can help in this situation by expanding cities and creating more area residential estates in rural area. For instance,  a fast-growing city has provided accommodation  supplying population growth by building up amenity facilities such as houses, factories, and villages in the outskirt area. Additionally,  some countries are enacting a policy for their citizen to tackle this problem by reducing building prices in the outer zone while increasing the tax on shack ownership in the city centre.

Housing shortages in big cities can cause severe social consequences. Some people think only  government action can solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent years, the increasing population has caused trouble in purchasing lands. On the one hand,  the society argues the fact that authorities should make remedy actions to fix an issue of inadequate  residences. However, on other hand, people themselves should solve this issue. I partially agree  with the given statement, and I will provide the substantiate argument in upcoming  paragraphs.  To commence, the government should restrict the allocation of land. To put it another way, government should apply more taxes to real estate so that they limit the making of houses.  Moreover, a focus on vertical housing would help to resolve the issue of even distribution of  homes. As an illustration, the apartments, and townhouses in developed cities like Singapore,  are made in a vertical manner in limited areas. Furthermore, authorities should apply more taxes  to bungalows and large houses. Therefore, people would purchase less of them. As an example,  the Canadian government restrict the purchase of houses for two years to resolve the issue of housing shortage.  On a contrary, people could also solve this issue by themselves. To simplify, they should prefer  living in villages and outskirts of towns instead of living in bigger cities. People can find more job  opportunities like farming in villages to earn a livelihood. This would help in bringing more  employment in the country and in this manner, society could also develop the villages. The fresh air  of villages would also make people more healthy and less stressed. Therefore, it would reduce  crimes in society.  To conclude, although people move to metropolitan cities in search of better opportunities,  they still face residential issues. Therefore, it is the responsibility of both government and people to resolve the issue by encouraging people to live in vertical housing and villages.","### Task Achievement:

The point of start work straight after school is so stunningly solution .Lots of people want to earn money as soon as available.And this is crucial reason to start working after high-school.Because of job,many teenagers are able to get experience to future humanity career.This means that,on account of less responsibility on your head,when you make a significant mistake in your teenager ages,you would have to more chances to correct it than in adult years.But the accomplish,which you can get at the your job time,will be able to help you in your future position in each sphere.

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a
successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is often said that if people desire to have a successful life, they need to face challenges and should not recoil from failure. From my perspective, even though facing risk means one might suffer from setbacks and the apprehension of making the wrong step, I believe the conducive effects which derive from it can outweigh the disadvantages.

Taking risks is by no means an easy task, people might fringe themselves from the consequence of failure. However, without these challenges, an individual can lose the chance to succeed as well as know one’s limits. If people surmount the difficulties and reach the goal, the fruition is incompatible, and the experience of success can also enhance one’s confidence in facing different scenarios in the future. In addition, if failure really occurred, lessons can also be learned and experience can be amassed through the mistake, which can further avail people in averting the same mistake while preparing themselves for  better performance.

People who stand on the opposite side might  assert that taking risks could result in pressure, which can turn out to be detrimental for individuals, leading to  underperformance, eventually. However, they might overlook the fact that on most occasions, failure is unavoidable; the way to overcome the fear is to face it. People who are always trying to escape from facing failure will stand no chance to improve themselves, as mentioned, failure can be conducive if people are willing to accept it, the experience accumulated in the process can avail oneself in dealing with manifold situations while remaining calm in the future.

Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to successful career. While others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"Without any ,doubt society is divided into two groups as per the distinct mindsets of different people. Therefore, this has become a debate able issue whether to make a successful career an individual should study at university or college, or they should immediately find  employment right after completing  school. This essay will not only shed light on both the perceptions but also my point of view will be elaborated in the conclusion

On one side of the argument there are people who argue that the benefits of studying at university or college considerably outweigh its disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is while doing higher education students mind become more broaden, for example when I was in a school, I studied many computer courses but I only gained the basic understanding of the subjects  because schools don’t teach core concepts they just provide basic knowledge to the students which is not enough for them to become a successful person in this modern technological world, On the other hand when I attended the university I got more understanding because of the practical knowledge that I got from there as the university prepares students to be more hands-on rather than just providing theoretical information, for instance, according to recent research conducted by googling it is observed that 80% of universities don’t teach only theoretical knowledge of the subjects but side-by-side also teach practical understanding, so that students should be ready to crack any job interview and get the job which they wanted 

On the other hand, it is also possible to make the opposing case it is often argued that students should start the jobs straight after finishing their initial education people often have this opinion because they think that they would become more responsible and would have more practical knowledge as compared to those who directly enrol themselves in higher education. To exemplify it one of my friends was doing a job right after finishing  school, he was doing a job in the automobile industry and was earning a good amount of money apart from that he also paid his complete education fee on his own he didn’t take a single penny from his parents, his father always say that I am proud of my son that how responsible he was during his early age of life, secondly he got  admission in the engineering university and was doing automobile engineering and he always scored good marks in every subject not only that he also got the job right after completing his degree because he already had a decent amount of experience in this industry he did not found the job, job found him, hence it is also suggested that students should start the job after completing his or her school 

As we have seen that there are no easy answers to these questions. On balance ,however, I believe that individuals should complete their higher education first rather than doing any kind of employment","**Task Achievement:** 3

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","After finishing  school, everyone should think about what they will do next. While some think that getting a position after high school is the best option, I agree with those who suggest that a student can have a shining future if they go study at a university or college. 

Many people believe that it is unnecessary to enter other institutions in due to receive a great job. Proponents of this view may suggest that young people should go to  work after finishing their studies at school because former pupils can start earning money and learning how it is to be an adult. For example, my friend's parents suggested her to get a job after her study, and she started earning money for her living in the cafe. However, It was the only place where she could work after school, but at least, she managed to make some money for herself.

On the other hand, I am in agreement with those who say that in order to have a great profession, students have to get further knowledge. An important reason is that you can only get a well-paid position if you have  evidence of your knowledge. For instance, you can not work at a law company or at a hospital without finishing particular courses.

In conclusion, whereas many are convinced that the best variant would be to go working after getting basic education, I side with those who suggest that if people want to receive a great job, they have to enter  university.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

Discuss both views, and give your opinion.","Most of the students who are trying to get a good job or business right after their schooling is often failing. But  the people who are choosing to study in the educational institution/university and take a little more time are easily getting a successful career.

Firstly, most of the admission have vast knowledge in Universities that help them to get a successful job. In ,Universities admissions are intended to get more experience before and there are lots of paths that can lead to the right way. For ,example a student who is new to the educational institution comes in and doesn't know what to do or what to be, he can learn what the academy teaches and what he likes to do so he can follow that path. However ,on the other hand,  the enlistments  that are looking for jobs right after their schooling is often failing. For instance, you just finished your schooling and have no idea of what you are going to be, and how to be it, it will take a long time to learn it. For ,example if an enlistment wants to learn how to be a doctor he can go to college, he can read books, attend classes, etc.  Do you know that if a student becomes an adult and didn't finish college yet he can choose to finish it when he is an adult?

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believes that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Education is one of the most crucial parts of people's lives. Some people are firm believers in getting higher education before working. Others, however, have shown intense devotion to getting a job. This essay will discuss both points of views and explain my opinion.

The first and most obvious one is gaining specific knowledge. There are many professions requiring specific academics such as doctor, lawyer and accountant which the school did not have in a syllabus. Thus, these kinds of curriculum have to be learned in the colledge. Moreover, the difference between university and school is self-study. The rationale behind this is that students have to do research by themselves by data-gathering and synthesising sources.

On the other hand, some people believe in direct working. This is an account of the more they work the more soft-skill they get, so these people will have more experience in working compared to the one in the same age. A great example for this can be seen that artists do not require a college diploma or entrepreneurs can learn by trying and making a lot of mistakes.

In conclusion, there are several benefits both in future study and going straight to work. From my perspective, working or internship before learning at university is the best solution. This is an account of ensuring the passion that they have to spend less of their life. According to research from a local university, it indicates that more than 40 percent of learners are not satisfied with their faculty leading to lack of passion to study. However, the students who have internships before  learning are eager to learn and tend to be successful in their future life.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.


Discuss both views and give your opinion?","A faction of the society opines that working right after completing school has better career prospects. However, the other set believes in the importance of college or university learning in charting a successful and prosperous career. Despite seeing many examples of college dropouts building huge businesses, I strongly agree with the latter view that academic education plays a critical role in a person's career path.

On the one hand, the obvious reason for recommending working right after completing school, is the success of a few billionaires who skipped academics and made it big. For example, Facebook built by Mark Zuckerberg, and Apple built by Steve Jobs are inspiring stories of college dropouts. Both these highly talented individuals did not complete university education and rather went about building their companies which are now massive business conglomerates. On the other hand, many stories of thousands of college dropouts are unknown because they did not find good jobs or create a successful business, and are still struggling to make ends meet. Therefore, it is incorrect to bias one's opinion, keeping in mind, only a few successful people. 

In contrast, the benefits of completing higher studies are manifold. Not only does the individual gain immense knowledge, but also gets to build a huge network of friends and acquaintances. The course curriculum often teaches examples of hundreds of companies and the reasons of their pitfalls and success. Furthermore, this knowledge gathered by discussing case-studies with peers is considered immensely beneficial later in their careers. To illustrate it further, an extensive survey conducted on 1000 executives of mid-sized companies, demonstrated that almost 80% of them gave credit to their alma mater for the success they have built. In addition, they always prefer to choose employees who have completed their college education.

In conclusion, from the arguments and explanation given above it is clear that despite having a few phenomenal college dropouts, majority people in the society value higher education. I firmly believe that completing higher studies is an imperative determinant of one's future career success, and strongly advocate that students should not drop out midway during their studies.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others think that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Upon high school graduation, students face the dilemma of continuing their studies at university or taking a job. While some believe it is better to pursue higher education, I agree with the idea that enrolling at a university leads to more success in their careers.
Some may argue that working after high school helps those graduates develop an independent life and gives them an insight into their future careers. First, they can learn to live independently by managing their own income and spending. In Vietnam, students taking jobs after high school and living away from their parents are more self-reliant adults who can cover the compounding costs of accommodation, transport and food without asking their parents for a monthly spending allowance. Second, they are given the opportunity and time to observe how other people work in their workplaces. As a result, they may acquire a better understanding of their chosen profession and thus make a rational decision about their future, whether it is better to go back to university or to run a business. 
However, I believe it is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. One benefit is qualifications are an essential prerequisite for employment in certain professions. It is considered illegal to practice medicine without medical degrees or give legal advice without law degrees in most countries in the world. Another benefit is people with post-secondary education and years of experience in an industry have a higher chance of rising to the top and becoming leaders or managers of their companies. This is because the diplomas or degrees in addition to work experience they possess can convince others that they the necessary skills to regulate the operation of a company’s department.  
In conclusion, while the option to work after school seems attractive for several reasons, I believe that pursuing a degree is more likely to lead to an envious career.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","There has been a difference of opinion regarding the merits of continuing a higher education as people believe that is better to get a job straight after school. I would argue that are more benefits in going to college or university. 
The option to start a work immediately is attractive for several reasons. The access to have an independent lifestyle as long as younger people start earning money, a wider range of possibilities come with it. In this way, they will be able to afford their own apartment or start a new family. In terms of their career, getting a job brings the opportunity to gain experience in specific fields. Indeed, spend time working in a real industry and sharing different points of views with co-workers and bosses, gives an invaluable knowledge about the process.  
Despite the arguments mentioned above, I believe that is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in the majority of professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having a degree. As a result, nowadays a large number of industries and hospitals are only hiring people who have a bachelor degree or higher. Secondly, in recent years, the job market is becoming more competitive and sometimes there are hundred of applicants for one position in a company. Subsequently, young people who do not have a degree will not be able to compete and without a job is more difficult to continue growing in a career. 
By way of conclusion, I believe that students will be more successful in their lives if they continue their studies beyond school level.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school.

While some people believe that to be successful university or college education is important, others argue it to be unnecessary and one should start working after their secondary schooling. I would agree with the former view, however, both the sides will be dicussed.


To begin with, those who believe that joining a job staright after school is better argue that in higher institutions only theorectical knowledge is imparted whereas in real life practical knowledge is more important. For instance, to become a car mechanic only practical knowledge about how to repair a car is required and one gains expertise in skills with experience. Moreover, by doing a job straight after school one can  start earning and become self- dependent. In other word they do not need to ask for pocket money, while their counterparts be still be dependent upon their parents. 


However, I strongly belive that university education is improtant. One of the benefit of university education is that an individual learn basics of the major course. This narrows down their focus and helps them to gain perfection in their field. Furthermore, nowadays it is essential for an individual to aquire university education to qualify for a job. Many professions such as doctor, lawyer require license which can be only gained by appropriate qualification. If the individual have a degree then only they can earn a white collar job and a good salary.

Otherwise, some  choose to apply for work instead of getting a diploma from college. Pros and cons of early employment will be discussed in this essay briefly. 
Students that struggle with financial problems tend to stop reaching higher level of academic and enter the workforce after finishing highschool. Working early will help them to be sustainable with their daily purposes like accommodation. Moreover, they can support their family finance and gain more experiences in life, compared to their peers. So that, jumping straight into work after school will help people to avoid some expenses like tuition fee, living costs, which is pretty expensive and instantly make money to afford their lives 
However, this seems to be not an ideal choice for numerous people. Recently, it might be difficult to get a job steadily without a degree from university. It is because in today’s society, jobs mostly require technological knowledge or computing skills because of the rapid development. So that, without some specific diplomas, people could only enter labour work like plumber or tailor factory, which has lower wages and maybe worse working environment than intellectual work.

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a
a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after
school.
Discuss both views and give your opinion","There is always a conflict for a student whether to aim towards getting work or opt for a graduate degree. Some people think it is favourable to go for higher studies, however, others believe it is best to get a job immediately after school. In this essay, we will discuss both the views and provide evidence on why it is better to go to a university or college.

On one side, there are individuals who argue that opting for skilled labour as soon as a student finishes the secondary education is more preferable as it has its own perks. One of the main reasons, students currently choose to get the work after secondary education is because they want to be independent. For example, today's teenager thinks that, as soon as they start working, they can earn money and get settled by themselves rather than depending on others. This thought of being self-sufficient and independent has pushed a lot of youngsters today in getting placements soon after schooling.

On the contrary, it is often argued that having a degree from a university or an institute has been always beneficial for an individual as it will yield them to get a successful career in a sector where there is a requirement for a graduate certificate. For instance, to acquire a job in the field of doctor, teacher or lawyer a specific area of degree is compulsory. One cannot obtain such a profound career without having an academic background. Therefore, having a higher qualification is essential to have a better job opportunity.

In conclusion, I would say that it is always more enticing for youngsters these days to grab the opportunity of working and settling after the school finishes, nonetheless, in my perspective to pursue a specialized occupation, it is necessary to have a proper education from a recognized institution or university.","**Task Achievement: 6**

"Some people believe that studying at university or college is the best route to a successful career, while others believe that it is better to get a job straight after school. Discuss both views.","Whether a university’s role should be to prepare graduates for specific jobs or simply to educate without a particular vocation in mind is a debatable issue. This essay believes that universities fulfil both purposes. The essay will first discuss the function of vocational courses, followed by a discussion of more traditional tertiary education.

Some students have a very specific job in mind when they enrol at university. Medicine, dentistry and accountancy have clear career paths and they allow people to focus on and then undertake a certain profession upon graduation. This suits those who have decided on a career and it avoids them wasting time studying a more general subject like English. For instance, in the United States, you must complete four years of higher education before you can study law and many feel that these four years are a waste of time, that would have been better used focusing on their chosen discipline.

However, this is not suitable for everyone and many people have no idea what job they would like to do when they are 18. For these young people, it is better to do a non-vocational course, such as philosophy and simply add to their intellect without a career goal in mind. If they were forced to study a more practical subject, they are more likely to quit or become disillusioned because they don’t see the point of their chosen subject. For example, The Times recently reported that only 50% of law graduates actually want to become lawyers at the end of their studies.

In conclusion, the function of the college is to both prepare students for the workforce and provide knowledge and which one a person chooses should depend on their preference at the time.","**Task Achievement:**

Education of young people is highly prioritized in many countries. However educating adults who cannot write or read is even more important and governments should spend more money on this. To what extent do you agree or disagree,"Education of young individuals is highly prioritized in many countries, however, there are adults who are not able to write or read and I strongly agree that educating them is more crucial and governments should take some measures and spend money on this.

To begin with, there is no doubt that today education is essential and it should be prioritized, hence from my point of view there should not be a person who can not read or write. And that is the reason why I strongly believe that governments should spend more money on this, for instance nowadays unfortunately there are many people who can not afford to go to school and be educated due the the lack of money but if governments give those residents money to attend to school and learn how to write or read that problem will be solved in no time.

Secondly, if people do not know how to write or read they will never be able to find a job and needless to say that without working they can not survive and it can lead them to commit crimes to live. For example, they can rob others, I remember 2 years ago I read that an adult robbed a family to feed him and his family, consequently governments from around the world should spend as much money as they can to help these adults educate.

In conclusion, personally, I reckon that educating adults who can not write or read is vital and governments should spend more money on this, otherwise, it can lead to terrible consequences.","**Task Achievement:**

In contrast, it is considered by others that adult nations who can not know read and write are very critical and the government should give them more payment. In my opinion, I believe that the ministry should provide more money for young people. However, adult nations need to study how to read and write, so the polity has to cover their needs and specialized some money for them. 

    One evident benefit of outlaying more pay to study young public is  to flourish the economy  the workforce and their energy.

For instance, if adult folk have a background or ideas that will affect  their knowledge of their young generation. Also, they want to save their rights to teaching.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Education is an inevitable factor in life and most of the countries following the same in the case of young people but in the fact of adults who do not know writing and reading some people believe that authorities should spend more money on their education. However, I totally agree with the statement and explain the reasons in the following essay.

Firstly, the unliterary people are facing many problems due to the improper knowledge of examine and writing. For example, when they go for their different needs they want to depend on others to help them translate the data. Also, to fill the forms or applications for various situations like the hospital, bank, and all. Therefore, it creates a lot of issues when always required the support of others. Moreover, to find a job basic education is a must. Particularly, for communication as well as knowledge.

In addition to that, when traveling from one place to another at least to read the name board of the place reading accuracy should be necessary. On the other hand, uneducation maybe not be their mistake may it caused due to their circumstances. For instance, in the early days, the education facilities and financial background are not much stronger than now. Hence, it might lose the chance for their academic. Furthermore, right now if the government helps them to learn minimum basic education as free it will provide good support and future for the uneducated adult people. 

To conclude, living without dependency even in writing and reading is essential. So, authorities should take maximum measurements for that. Not only does it help them to live independently but also gives an option for opportunities.","**Task Achievement:** 6.5

Some people believe that governments should make laws about people’s nutrition and food choice while others argue that it is their choice. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"The pattern of eating food has been evolving for many years. Therefore, public authorities should regulate the consumption of eatables thinking some folks while other opposes that humans should not be limited for the same. Analysing that I opine, the ministry needs to make laws in order to create a barrier for obesity and health problems that are being faced by humans globally.

On the one hand, more and more population is becoming obese as junk food is the major meal of the day. In America, almost 60 per cent of the citizens rely upon burgers and pizzas for their daily consumption as it is readily available and tasty in comparison to other eatables. Clearly, such sort of health concerns is alarming to the law because citizens are being careless by choosing unhealthy preferences. Thus, it needs to regulate strict laws like banning fast-food chains in order to create awareness among residents.

On the other hand, it is a basic right of the public to consume as per their taste buds. Consequently, government has no role to play in this case yet society should be clearly responsible for the products they eat. From some stats, it led to a big fight when some people protested to close the pizza stores all over the country. Furthermore, every individual has the freedom to consume as per their desire even if it is harmful to them, they are only responsible for it. If it is not harming others then why would authorities need to make any laws since the population is only to be blamed for the damage they are causing to themselves?

In conclusion, in my opinion, the health issues arising around the Earth mainly contributing to humans not eating healthy food should be considered by the government as it is causing damage to the mass now. Although the public has the right to eat whatever they want, lawmakers should regulate it because  the problems like obesity are elevating.","## Task Achievement:

"Nowadays, more and more people want to get things done instantly (services, information,

tasks). Why is this? Do you think this is a positive or negative development?","In recent times, many people want their work to be done immediately. I think this is because of the internet, which many people used to do their tasks within minutes. In my opinion, While it has made life easier for many people, others could suffer from chronic illness.

Now, some people are used to the speed; this is due to the existence of the internet in their life. In fact, many governmental institutions migrated to the internet because by doing this, many people can pay online and avoid spending most of their time in long boring queues. As a result, some people tended to do their work with a couple of screen clicks.

On the bright side, doing tasks in no time has made many people feel comfortable. For example, before the invention of the internet, people who were carrying out research had been struggling to find the information. In other words, people instead of spending days at the library trying to get the correct data, it takes a couple of minutes over the internet to find it. Despite finishing work almost immediately has its positives; however, some people suffer from chronic diseases.

By contrast, if many people tried to finish work promptly, they would most likely suffer from stress. As a matter of fact, these people who are trying to deliver their tasks quickly will often negatively affect their health. As a consequence, as long as people are always stressed, they will most probably struggle with chronic diseases such as Hypertension and Diabetes.

To conclude, life has become faster due to the existence of the internet.

Apparently, the current generation has cheap and fast access to the internet, which has made many tasks quite easy and can be done immediately within few clicks.For instance, for booking a train ticket earlier, a travel agent was required, which now can be done within minutes on internet.Moreover, anyone can now have a video conferencing from one part of the world to the other part of the globe with their mobile phone and internet, which was implausible few decades ago.Thus, easy, and handy access to almost everything has led to the increase of expectations of the people.
Although, these inventions have done wonders for the humankind, in my opinion, there has been a significant negative development as well.For instance, nowadays a lot of youths are experiencing anxiety issues in contrast to previous generations.Moreover, excessive use technology is having a detrimental long term effect on physical and mental health of every individual.Additionally, it has been observed that now people are less patient and hard working as compared to our ancestors.Thus, the technology upgrade has led to changes in the attitude, which is having a serious negative impact on the society.

"Some people think that it is a waste of money for countries to host big sporting events like the world cup, and that the money would be better spent on other things. However, others think that hosting large sporting events has a clear, positive impact on a country.
Discuss both these views and give your opinion.
","People have different opinions as to whether nations should spend the national budget on hosting international sporting events. Personally, I believe that the events have beneficial impacts on the host nations as a whole.
    Advocates of the former view might assert that spending on sporting events could hurt countries’ economies. Staging the international sporting events would incur enormous expenses, to the detriment of the host nations’ budgets. The expenditure on renovating their stadiums, implementing higher levels of security, and hiring performance artists is so significant that hardly can poverty-stricken nations afford it. For example, instead of spending billions of dollars on hosting the 2010 World Cup and then drowning in debt, South Africa should have been expended those budgets on addressing the physiological needs of their citizens, such as improving the standard of living and eliminating starvation.
    However, I support the view that nations might reap a multiplicity of benefits from staging those sporting events. Firstly, A wide range of employment opportunities are available during years of planning and investment, and this will contribute to a decrease in unemployment. Secondly,  enthusiasm and excitement are an indispensable part of these events; it is clear from this emotional boost that people of the host nations will experience a drastic improvement in their life satisfaction. Lastly, such events are conducive to the development of culture and tourism in the host nations. Social cohesion and cultural understanding are further developed, thanks to stadiums and arenas thronged with flows of people from all over the world.  
    In conclusion, I concur with the portion of people who believe that the benefits of hosting international events would outweigh the drawbacks, although it might dig immensely into countries’ economies.","## Task Achievement:

"Write about the following topic.

Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. To what extent do you agree or disagree? 

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

You should write at least 250 words.","At present, the hiring process has become more complex and competitive in the job market, and priorities various qualities are often employed when evaluating job applicants. Some people argue that not only academic qualifications are highly required, but also extroversion is also have great importance. This essay supports the assertion to a major extent despite some inhibitions.

To embark on, one of the paramount reasons is effective communication is a vital skill in any professional setting. This means that employers value candidates who can express themself clearly  interact confidently with their colleagues and handle client and other related professionals. The best illustration is  customer service, an employer could able to communicate properly and address customer concerns to satisfy and express loyalty. Probing further, strong social skills built an individual reputation, resolved conflicts, and collaborated with the team.

On the other side, teamwork is another crucial aspect of the modern workspace. Employers often prioritize candidates who can work collaboratively, contribute ideas practically as well as theoretically and adapt to different teams. For instance, employers in construction project-based work have a combination of social skills to effectively coordinate with the workers and a theoretical understanding to solve problems that may arise on the construction site.

To conclude, social skills demonstrate a candidate's ability and quality of work with their colleagues and clients although academic qualifications elaborate the knowledge and experience in a particular field. Effective communication and teamwork are fundamental to success in today's professional work environments. I believe that both played essential roles in the modern era.","**Task Achievement:**

Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some recruiters suppose that for candidates, soft skills are more crucial than their academic background. I totally agree with this notion, as social capacities are essential when looking for a job. 

The excellent soft skills of job seekers have apparent benefits. Firstly, communication is one of the most important skill for everyone. This is primarily because in modern days, you have to interact with different people. Good communication helps you to explain your idea in a clear way and make others understand what you are talking about. Secondly, various companies demand teamwork skills, which means that employees need to coordinate with colleagues and superiors at work. This not only helps their work complete smoothly but also brings high efficiency. 

Nowadays, academic qualifications are still a prerequisite when applying for a job at many companies. Apparently, many positions require a certain academic level, it evaluates a person's academic ability and prospects in the professional field he or she studies. However, applying school knowledge to real work is quite a challenge. Therefore, during the recruitment process, some employers soon realized that other social experiences are also necessary and play an important role. They contribute greatly to timely and efficient completion. Therefore, I think these soft skills are extremely important for candidates when looking for a job.

Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Some recruiters suppose that for candidates, soft skills are more crucial than academic background. I totally agree with this notion as social abilities are the bottom line when getting jobs.

Firstly, being equipped with interpersonal skills such as communicating and interacting with co-workers helps job applicants to discuss with others and figure out solutions in any type of working environment. Hence, even a newbie who does not much specialized knowledge can contribute to solving and accomplishing assignments. Although academic capabilities play vital roles in the working process, they might become less effective in teamwork tasks requiring novel ideas from different perspectives if individuals are not able to connect with other colleagues in the workplace.

Secondly, the ability to multitask is also important in people’s careers, especially in these days and ages when everything happens fast and simultaneously. If a worker is merely good at technical knowledge, he might be confused due to a lack of capability to complete different tasks constantly. Consequently, he will become overwhelmed by heavy workloads with tight deadlines then. For instance, in the advertising field, being able to handle many tasks is always prioritized as the employees have to monitor campaigns, make new plans and meet clients’ requests at the same time and their performance outcomes will be evaluated based on all the aforementioned scopes as opposed to solely professional knowledge.

In conclusion, despite the undeniable importance of candidates’ educational backgrounds, I believe that being good at soft skills such as communication or multitasking is crucial in people’s careers since it can help them to improve not only individual results but also collective outcomes.","**Task Achievement:** 6.5

Job applicants’ social skills are more important. Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"Some recruiters value social skills more than academic qualifications when it comes to assessing candidates. I disapprove of this opinion because our professionals will help us most in handling tasks, and interpersonal ability can be acquired continuously after being employed.

First and foremost, many jobs prioritize your certificates or experience in relevant areas. For example, right at the first round of employment, programmers are required to finish at least a good Bachelor's degree in computer science in order to pass. This is because this type of document reflects clearly your level of problem-solving, critical thinking and understanding of what you're going to do in those positions, otherwise, just being decent in sociability doesn't help you anything in coding or system designing.

My second argument is that people skills can be gained through the working process. For instance, most technological firms in Vietnam often organize seminars or side activities to consolidate their employees' communication and English qualities. By doing so, instead of including conversational potential as a must-have criterion when interviewing, companies can teach their staff later, encouraging them to develop their well-rounded capability to be able to promote themselves to higher positions such as project manager or negotiator, and more than that, it's also the best way to bond every member in the organization together.

To conclude, some employers say that for an applicant, his social qualities are more valuable than his achievements in education. I strongly refute this point of view since the knowledge you obtain from your academy is the most helpful tool to complete your deadlines, as well as people can ongoingly learn soft abilities after joining the companies.","**Task Achievement:**

Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It can be viewed nowadays that some people are employed but not according to the degree that they completed in the university. This is because their authority has seen their potential skills not aligned with their bachelor's degree. I strongly believe the administration employs workers according to their skills, not their scholastic qualifications.  In the following paragraphs, I will discuss my point of view to attest to my belief and provide additional examples to support my claim.

Many believe that if someone gets hold of their diploma and earns high marks written in their transcript of records would entitle them to land a good position in their job; however, executives do not see it that way. Graduating from an elite University does not guarantee that your first job will give you a six-digit salary. One should be able to apply all the theories he has learned; with this, the company employee evaluators will see if his skill matches his credentials. As a teacher, when I applied for my first teaching job, I underwent an interview process following a written test. I was asked to do a teaching demonstration in front of the other applicants, which tested my skills to the core. Had I not delivered a proper and satisfying demonstration, I would not have continued to explore and expand my skills further. 

In conclusion, I believe that the association board search for applicants that can perform better than just looking at their inked marks on a piece of paper attesting that they are degree holders. They can hone skills to make such applicants become part of the team and make that employee an asset in the company.","### Task Achievement:

"Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications.
Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?","In today's ,world social skills are given utmost importance over the educational background and many of the recruiters try to employ candidates with such qualities.  I partially agree with the statement and I would like to elaborate on it in detail below.

The merits of outstanding social skills are apparent.  Firstly, communication is the key factor that helps to interact with different people on the whole and assists in creating a good buyer-seller relationship.  It can promote the growth of the business too.  Secondly, by having good communication skills anyone can excel in their respective fields either it may be sales or any other departments for the matter of fact.  For example, an employee with excellent presentation expertise can help customers understand the products and can convey them to buy that product.  Furthermore, employees with better interaction skills are generally easygoing, which is crucial for the workplace and the employer too.

In contrast, some people believe that academics are the pre-requisites of  employment.  Apparently, there are many positions that require high knowledge and capability of dealing with them smoothly.  For example, an administrative role in a company requires the applicant to have high qualifications to take prompt managerial decisions.  Such qualities are developed when a person has studied the subjects thoroughly.  Not only having social skills but also acquiring higher studies is equally important to run any organization smoothly.

In conclusion, I think both advanced studies and other communicational skills are of equal importance in today’s world.  Having workers with both these qualities make an organization grow and prosper thereby helping in building a strong workforce altogether.","### Task Achievement:

Some employers believe that job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?,"There has been much discussion revolving around the issue of whether job applicants’ social skills are more important than their academic qualifications. In this essay, I will explain why social skills are more vital, compared with academic qualifications.

The merits of outstanding social skills are apparent. Firstly, communication is the key to career success in this day and age. This is mainly due to the fact that the 21st century is best characterised by constant interaction with different people, no matter the communication happens in person or online. Secondly, the ability to sell products or services is of paramount significance in any business – this requires strong social skills. For example, an employee with excellent social skills is able to have an impact in front of customers or clients; as a result, products or services can be perceived as high-value. Furthermore, employees with better social skills are generally more easy-going, which is very important to the workplace, including the employer. After all, as the saying goes, “Who you work with is as important as what you do.” – An enjoyable work environment needs socially skilful employees.

In contrast, some others may claim that academic qualifications are the pre-requisite of employment. Apparently, many positions require certain qualifications. However, in modern-day society, more and more employers have realised that whether employees can get the results that the business wants is the key to a business’ success. It can be seen that qualifications do not play a key role in this regard.

Having considered both views, I think employees’ social skills are of overriding importance for an organisation. Also, I would suggest employers consider job applicants’ social skills first, which I believe is soundly based on the above reasoning I have presented.","## Task Achievement:

"SOme believe that many countries, the investment of public money in arts can be justified. Other think that the government should spend more on health and education. Discuss both views and give your opinion","A number of countries are belived to spend money for art activities various acceptable reasons, whereas opponents argue that the governments should fund wellbeing and education sectors more than cultural issues. I definetely agree with former idea due to the fact that I belive that there are no differences between arts and other sevices like schools and hospitals.

To begin with, art one of the most essential ways to be get close the society and to boost the cultural level of the community. For example, establishing vary of art museums, cinemas and concert buildings  enables to create common values for citizens. İf these places had not opened, people would not reach the opportunitiy which can strength invisible emotional communication among the society. In other words, spending money to art sector not only does has effects on community in visible way, but also it might contribute to progress relationships between the citizens. Therefore, funding art definetely is not waste money and it has equal importance like health services.

On the other hand, no one can deny that public services such as medical services and colleges which provide to live better condition for poeple, one of the most crucial tools to take after its own citizens for rulers. To illusrate, progress of human history generally has been based on novelties which have involved overcoming health and education problems. In fact, the history has shown that the mankind could live more than it had lived thanks to capability of medical services and it have learned that to raech this proficiency have been needed the schools.  Yet, although schools and hospitals quite essential for society, it should be considered that art activities have huge importance in the same way.

"In many countries, Government likes to spend more money on the arts. Some people agree with this. Others think the government should spend more on health and education. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","According to a section of society, funding on arts by government is acceptable ; However, Others expect regime is spending more in public services such as education and health. In my opinion, government should be investing more money on public institutes.

To embark on, it is important to spend of arts. If  an administration of a country decided to stop funding for music, theatre etc., it would be a serious mistake and that could be destroy national identity. If any country does not emphatize to preverving  folk music , arts, theatre; That will be gradually disappearing. As well as preservating  art will lead great impact on tourism.If people find intersting about about a culture they visit there. As an exemplification,There are 6.2 million traveller visit in the Louver museum in 2012 and luver’s anuual income reached 216 millon dollers.

On the contrary, Improving public services is crucial for developing a country. First investing in education are beneficial for long term.

"In many countries, the government likes to spend more money on the arts. Some people agree with this. However, others think government should spend more on health and eduation. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","It is one of the fads that many countries nowadays pour more funds in art and many people hold the view spent money on arts is necessary, while another group of thinkers support that government funds should be invested on public services and facilities. This essay will highlight both opinions and also elaborate that art certainly requires mastery over the fundamental of it and thus will lead to a logical conclusion.

There are myriad of reasons which will further explain this argument but the most preponderant one stems from the fact that art is a basic human need and so government has a duty to satisfy this need as other need. If governonce spend lot of money on arts they can see new talented artists in own nation. Moreover, another pivotel aspect of this argument is that artists play a vital role for masses. Because they paint various painting regarding culture and traditions as well as many painting are keep in the museum and many individuals like go to museums. For example, we increase their knowledge about history,culture and tradition through movies, songs and paintings made by artists.

On the contrary, the latter view suggest that union should spend money on public services and facilities instead in art. They may think that citizens can reap more benefits from public services and facilities. For instance, with more money spent in progressing education and medical system, students can receive better education to improve employability and patients have more chances to survive from severe diseases. Besides this, nowadays abound individuals face major problem of unemployment. Therefore, government open new  companies and many people join new job and increase their knowledge and learn new skills thus, unemployment decrease day by day.

Historical objects should be brought back to their country of origin. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Historical objects are precious items that carry immense cultural and historical significance. They offer valuable glimpses into the past and act as tangible connections to our ancestry and heritage. According to a belief, it is crucial to repatriate these valuable treasures and preserve them in their original homeland. In this essay, I will elaborate on my strong agreement with this notion and shed light on my support for this subject.

Primarily, artefacts carry significant historical and cultural value for the people of a nation. For instance, the Koh-I-Noor diamond, once part of India's rich heritage, is now housed in the United Kingdom's Crown Jewels collection. Returning the Koh-I-Noor to India would be a meaningful gesture, as it holds deep cultural and historical importance for the Indian people. Consequently, it would allow them to reconnect with their past and preserve a piece of their heritage for future generations.

Furthermore, repatriating historical objects can play a crucial role in strengthening the nation's identity and pride. For example, The Sultan Ganj Buddha, an ancient bronze statue discovered in Bihar, is currently displayed in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in the United Kingdom. Returning the Sultan Ganj Buddha to India would be an opportunity to celebrate and appreciate Indian history and spirituality. Hence, having artefacts back in their original context could help  people develop a deeper understanding of their culture and traditions.

In conclusion, having engaged in the subject matter, while displaying the artefacts in foreign museums may offer educational benefits to people worldwide, we should consider the special significance of these objects to the people of their nation. Therefore, I strongly support the idea that historical objects should be bought back to their country of origin as it can help preserve the rich heritage and foster a stronger sense of national identity and pride.","### Task Achievement:

"some people say that increasing business and cultural contacts between countries would is a positive developement, while others think that many counntries will lose their national identities as a ruslt. Discuss both view and give your opinion?","It is believed that the international trade and cultural exchange between nations brings significant benefits for each side, while some others think that the tendency  causes  the loss of their traditional and cultural values. In my opinion, the advantages of this phenomenon overshadow the disadntages.

There are a number of reasons why some people believed that  developing business and cultural cooperation has an adverse impact on their national identities. First, the globalisation poses a serious threat to traditional and culture value of a nation. This can be explained by the fact that multinational corporations often use their national image and culture to advertise their items, which trigger curiously potential customers that come from overseas. For example, younger generation in Viet Nam tends to imitate lifestyle and fashion of Korean due to the influence of commercial channels, which poses many challenges for nations on how to maintain their nation identities.

However, In my opinion, I believed that   the positive outcomes of this tendency are immense. First, Multinational companies create a wide range  of job opportunities for local people, which help improve their living standard and boost the local economy. For instance, Apple company has provided thousands of jobs for workers in Viet Nam, Which help them avoid the risk of unemployment and live more comfortably. Second, International commerce and cultural exchange are considered as a golden chance for local companies to flourish in the global market. This means that, In order to compete with international companies, local companies have to be more creative and innovative, they also have much more opportunities to approach new technology and modern machines from other countries. A a result, they can product higher quality and cheaper items, which help them become more competitive with multinational companies. Finally, this trend gives people the chance to explore and understand deeply the culture of other countries. In fact, working in the multinational corporations, A person would expose   different cultures  and languages from their colleagues who come from other nations.

In conclusion, although this tendency poses challenges  for countries on how to prevent the negative influene of foreign culture, In my opinion, the cultural  and  businees cooperation brings considerably economical and social benefits for nations","**Task Achievement:**

"Some believe technology has made our lives too complex and the solution is to lead a simpler life without technology.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, many are of the opinion that technology has complicated our lives and that living without it would make life so much simpler. Although I agree that technology has drawbacks, turning our backs on it would be a huge setback for mankind.

To begin with, technology has played a crucial role in changing human communication, lifestyle and work for the better. Firstly, thanks to the invention of the Internet, people can now be updated with current affairs faster than ever. In addition, social apps such as Facebook and Twitter have allowed them to be in touch with their close ones more often with just a press of a button. Secondly, advances in broadcasting have provided numerous forms of entertainment. This greatly benefits individuals as well as improves their quality of life. Finally, the rise of automation has significantly reduced labour work and increased productivity. For example, manual tasks such as calculating or sorting, and memorizing can now be done by cutting-edge computers with high precision and reliability in a relatively short time. 

Even though technology has made our lives become more complicated and it is a negative trend, there are several measures to help to alleviate the problem. One of the most effective ways is to change individuals’ attitudes toward technology. Indeed, instead of considering it as an indispensable part of our life, people should treat technology as a tool with the sole purpose being to ease their lives. By doing so, they will not become too dependent on it and free their minds. Another possible way is returning to low-tech devices. To be specific, studies have shown that people may be happier and more satisfied if they are given fewer options in life. Hence, by using devices with few quirks and features, it is likely that they may experience a more fulfilling life, as well as appreciate what they have. For example, instead of using smartphones, millions of teenagers in Europe are now buying dial phones, also known as dumb-phones, because these help them to stay away from the dramas on social media, control their lives better, and see the world with more grace

In conclusion, while I agree that technology is making our lives more complex, humans will not likely lead a simpler life if we reject it. Instead, we should change our mindsets toward it and try to use low-tech devices rather than chasing after the latest technologies to live healthier and simpler.","### Task Achievement:

"Some believe technology has made our lives too complex and the solution is to lead a simpler life without technology.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Thanks to modern technology, our lives become easier and more time-saving. There is no doubt that in this society, technological development plays an essential role in all respect. Not only youngsters but also elderly people should be equipped with knowledge about technology.

Some people claimed that life would be less difficult without technology as it makes them tired and their lives are too complicated. I definitely disapprove about the idea. As I mentioned before, technology is an important part of our lives. Therefore, we should learn how to interact with modern technology instead of being controlled by it. The more the society develops, the more human beings have to improve their thoughts, their knowledge about anything. Technology should be considered an accompanist, a tool which support our lives. Or else, we, the human would turn out to be a slave. I mean, more and more people involved in technology addiction, especially the young. They spend all day looking at televisions, mobile phones, computers or tablets without mentioning their studying, family and friends. 

There are hundreds of well-known names, for instant: Google, iPhone, Amazon, Tesla,… which provide our human’s life with suitable multiple choices. If we do not know how to make a chocolate pie, just google on Google. What’s more, a mail sent from an overseas student to her family via E-mail for every single day within one minute is totally possible owing to the Internet – a great invention in human’s history instead of using postage by trains, wagons or even birds.

The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences .Only government action can solve this problem .To what extent do you agree or disagree,"Accommodation is an essential need in our lives.The scarcity of shelter can cause serious problems.Some people believe that it is the role of the government to solve problems of shelter.The government can act by creating affordable housing trusts , introducing new home zones and giving incentives to small builders.I completely agree that it is solely the government's responsibility to solve shelter deficits in cities.

The creation of affordable housing trusts aids by giving people mortgage to buy apartments that can be paid over a certain timeline.By building more apartments and giving loans it helps to mitigate the problems of housing in towns.For example an apartment can accommodate a tremendously higher number of individuals than a house which occupies and wastes land.Furthermore the government can introduce new home zones in virgin lands which are nearby the metropolitan.This is done to empower individuals who want to build houses and are unable to purchase land or apartments in the city.As a result it helps to decongest the number of people in towns and provides solutions to housing problems.

Also the government should give incentives to small builders to enter the market of constructing houses as independent builders.Likewise this helps people who are unable to afford professional builders to build their homes.In doing so the government will be increasing the number of houses for it's citizens.

In conclusion ,I believe that it is the government's main responsibility to curb the lack of homes in the metropolitan area by providing several measures to accommodate it's citizens.","## Task Achievement:

"The shortage of housing in big cities can cause severe consequences. Only government action can solve this problem.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The population growth in major cities and demand for houses has increased in parallel, which brings detrimental problems. It is said that just government can help to omit this issue which I believe is the same for these issues.

People would not expand their families unless their city could support all the family members' housing. As long as people could not find a city with large numbers of apartments or flats for their children to live in, they may not convince to bring their offspring. Consequently, governments should construct buildings to decrease public worries. Urban areas that are deprived of enough houses would not be enlarged in population; as a result, that country contains old society, and many economic problems would occur as well.

In addition, if people do not find any place to live in their city, they might immigrate to other cities or even other countries. People employed in a new job, young adults, in particular, want to live in a suitable house; if they have faced not having a home, they will resign or change their living areas. As a result, that town lost its workers, so in my opinion, governments should make architecters to design a place that can include many residents; moreover, develop the suburb to encourage people to live there to reduce problems. 

In conclusion, a shortage of living places stop families from bringing children and drops the number of jobs demanding, which hits the country's economic growth. From my point of view, governments must take actions to overcome this issue.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think the money spent on developing technology for space exploration is not justified. However, there are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","the issue of whether the money should be used justified has been raising a lot of debates. Some might say that there are so many ways to invest money such as help poor people, construct infrastructure or develop computers or so on. On the contrary, others insist on the opinion that in the development of technology, people should open their knowledge by exploring the earth to promote human life. Viewing from a general perspective, I personally agree with the former opinion for the following reasons.

To begin with, the funds of the countries should be invested in by taking care of the inhabitants and environment because this is the main factor which builds a nation. Firstly, citizens are the element of the foundation of the countries so if their life is great, the nation will be the development. For example, using funds to help the homeless have a house and settle down, if people’s lives are stable then the country will be stable. Secondly, building or repairing infrastructure makes the state look beautiful and clear because the outlook is traits to appreciate the development of the nation-states. For instance, fixing the old building can substantially help the countries become more developed and prosperous. Finally, make use of wealth on  growing the public, bringing the country's economy and socializing expansion.

On the other hand, some of the population think that exploring space can help  society predict everything before this happens so that a human can prepare to confront or find the way to fix it such as climate change or earthquake. However, if the crowd spend a lot of cash on space exploration and do not care about society and habitat 

In conclusion, it is not justified to invest money to investigate  the galaxy while there are so many beneficial ways to use capital like making the nation better than by caring for people and reducing the environment.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that money spent on developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The technology from the very beginning has two aspects, if it is used in the right way it is beneficial for survival, but if it is utilized in the wrong way it may be worse for the whole mankind. A  popular stratum of society believes that spending wealth in the development of space exploration is necessary. However, in its sharp contrast, others opine that it is the sheer wastage of money which could rather be used to eradicate other issues of the community. I would like to delve into both the arguments before making an opinion.

The first school of thought claims that evolution of space technology has brought humans the possibilities of life in outer space, which is a huge achievement. According to some researchers, the end of the earth can be expected as a consequence of factors like pollution, global warming, etc. So, the space scientists are working on projects to produce habitat on other planets. They believe that without exploring the space or other planet physically we cannot have any idea about it. Moreover, without having prior knowledge of other spheres we cannot live there. In addition to this, developing space technology is compulsory.

However, another group of person opines that spending wealth on space technology is surely a wastage of it. Every year a huge amount of money is spent on this by different countries to just prove their strength. They believe that as we live on earth humans should not face problems in their daily life to run their lives smoothly. Instead of spending too much money on space exploration program e governments should spend on social issues. For example, governments should provide jobs for their pupil, they should construct better infrastructure  for better development, they should provide better medical facilities and much more.

In the conclusion, I would conclude that developing automation for space exploration is good for mankind, but this fact cannot be denied that it requires a huge amount of fund. The governmental bodies should also keep a regular check on social issues to bring happiness into people's lives and on planet earth.","## Task Achievement:

"most people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. why? do the advantages of this outweigh its disadvantages? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples,e.g from your knowledge or experience","In the present age, people tend to have children at an older age. From my perspective, it has more drawbacks than benefits. This essay will discuss the main reasons associated with this epidemic and reveals why it has more disadvantages.

The main reasons for this global problem are people's career and their freedom. Nowadays, individuals' career and their position in society have great importance. Everyone tries to enhance their performance and get promoted; therefore, having a baby is a huge obstacle and prevents parents from reaching their goals. What's more, people without children have freedom. In other words, they do whatever they want and enjoy their lives. For example, a single person can travel or go to parties anytime without worrying about her baby.

However, having children at an older age has significant drawbacks. First of all, old parents' offspring may suffer some disorders like Down syndrome. This problem is more common among old mothers' children, which causes irreparable problems in society. Secondly, older parents are not energetic, and they can't play with their babies properly. They get bored easily, and in the future, because of a huge age difference, they can't understand children, and this causes a disparity between them. For instance, teens with young parents have a good relationship with them.

To conclude, having a baby in old age has various reasons, like the importance of job prospects and liberty. On the other hand, it has serious demerits like disability and parents' impatient. I personally believe that the benefits of this epidemic cannot overshadow the disadvantages.","**Task Achievement:**

"NOWADAYS, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE DECIDE TO HAVE CHILDREN  IN THEIR OLDER AGE. WHAT ARE THE REASONS? DO THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS OUTWEIGH DISADVANTAGES?","In the current era, Many individuals are prone to give birth in their older age for various reasons. Personally, elderly people are not an appropriate age to have a baby so negative outcomes would outweigh advantages.

Firstly, there are many crucial reasons why some individuals decide to have a baby at an old life in the developed world such as generating a bunch of income, which provides job security and a better lifestyle. Moreover, Some claim that giving childbirth at a young age when they are not ready not only provides a number of responsibilities to them but also reduces the freedom, which allows them to hang out with their comrades and family. In addition, from the medical surveys, 80% of mothers in an elderly life spend most of their time on hectic work due to lack of income.   

However, common abnormalities of childbirth such as Down syndrome, heart problems and other issues due to lack of nutrition in pregnancy are the most horrible effect which affects both mother's and offsprings' lifestyle in the short-term and long-term. Furthermore, the ability to take care of offspring at that life significantly decreases as they are too old to carry their offspring and play with them. Most medical research shows that a large number of abnormal children mostly happened in this phenomenon and mothers experienced losing childbirth before giving birth as physical issues. 

 In conclusion, Although generating incomes is vital for some communities, people should be more concerned about this as negative outcomes affect either mother or children, which leads to physical and mental issues after give-birth.","**Task Achievement:**

More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why? Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"In today's world,a lot of adults have begun to think that it will be better for them to give  birth to a child in a more mature age than people used to do in the past. There are different reasons which could support this decision and its benefits, but also there are some drawbacks which will be discussed in this essay.

On the one hand, it has become extremely popular among women to get pregnant at the age of 30-35 while earlier it was important to become a mother before 20. First of all, in the past,the main role of a woman was to be a good housewife and take care of children. This is because there were a lot of prejudices about the female part of  society and their duties to the world. Therefore, young girls used to think about pregnancy at the age of 18 since they were told that after this age it would be difficult to get a good family. For instance, the majority of women who lived in the Soviet Union under the pressure of  society were forced to give  birth at a very young age.

Doubtless, there are both advantages and disadvantages to this approach. Firstly, when a person becomes a parent at an adult age it is likely to have more opportunities for his child and would be able to be responsible for someone's life. On the other hand, with the time woman's ability to get pregnant decreases and it might be hard to give  birth at the age of 30. For example, some female could become infertile due to the fact that they didn't give  birth when they were young.

To conclude, the major reason for people to think about pregnancy at the more adult age is that they would be more responsible and would have an ability to give their infants everything they would need for  development. Advantages of this decision far outweigh its demerits.","**Task Achievement: 7.0**

Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. 
You should write at least 250 words.","In these career oriented world people are postponing their family planning to late stage of their life. Perhaps, the most important reason is goal oriented. In my opinion, benifits of having offsprings in later age offsets the drawbacks entailed by this trend, as one can focus on their career and enjoy their life.
The major disadvantage of this trend offers is related to health. Having childrens in later stage may pose a risk to the mother because they may not be healthy enough to give birth to child. These may result in birth of a child with abnormal syndrome. For example, a research published in gynegology has found that females giving birth after the age of 35 years are highly prone to give birth to a diseased child.
Firstly, primary reason behind planning children in later stage is that these days people are becoming more career oriented. These means that they have to put their energy, time and money in acheving their dreams.
These may make them competent for upbring of their childrens in a well manner.
Moreover, having childrens at later stage offers several advantages. The first obvious benifit is that people can acheive the heights in their careers as they can focus on theri career. They can devote all their resources and energy in to acheving their dreams. For instance, a growing body of research have found that 80% of people are successful in their career those who have planned their offspring in later stages of life.
Secondly, people can enjoy their life because they donot have responsibility of nuturing their childrens. This further encourages them to explore the world in the way they want. For example, they can travel to the tourist places, explore the landscape and culture of other nations. Also they can develop their hobbies.

"More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why? 
Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Among the various changes we are encountering daily between the previous and recent times, is the new mindset that prefers to have offsprings in an older age. This shall have some pros and cons but are these merits enough to take such decision or not?
In the past, women, whether educated they have been or not, were accustomed to getting married at her early 20s ages and directly have a baby on her bare hands just after one year of marriage. Since the life at such moments have been much easier, cheaper with less needs, for instance, one would only aim to send his child to a considerate school. To put it in another way, no luxurious requirements, unlike nowadays, as participating in a well-known club for different trainings and exercises or going out for costy trips frequently. Meanwhile, no much concentration was given to the way of raising children properly, but just in a similar method that this young mother has been brought up even if it was a false way of raising.
Nevertheless, at the recent moments, people are paying more attention to this issue regarding marriage and children. Should they be able to offer a relatively high standard of living to their children or not has become a serious concern that mostly yields to postponing the intention of having children just after marriage. For example, having a man in a relationship but never take a forward step until his savings reach to a couple of hundred thousands, this may last to up to 7 years. Despite being more immersed in work and practical life, youth are now frowning of taking a huge responsibility as marriage and bringing up children. Whilst these may not be positive reasons, a one crucial aspect is the delicate focus on how children are raised in order to supply them with proper mentality and spirit. For this specific purpose, I would greatly argue that the benefits of having children in older years exceeds its drawbacks.
In conclusion, to have children and bring them up properly is not easy matter, so the society is tending, conversely with the past, to do so at the most suitable age, which happens to be an older one. Many reasons for such way of thinking including mainly getting stable humans, for that in my view point, I think the strengths of this decision overcomes its weaknesses.","### Task Achievement:

"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have 

children later in their life. What are the reasons? Do the 

advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","In recent years, a noticeable shift in family planning has emerged and many people prefer to have children at their later stage in life. Several reasons are responsible for this, and I believe that it has more consequences. 

Firstly, couples want to spend quality time together before having their first child. This is because they can enjoy their life with each other, and be able to know one another. In this way, mutual understanding becomes stronger, and enjoy the time they spend with their young ones. For example, research studies have shown that couples who spend more time together understanding each other can later take good care of their babies and there is also less chance of divorce rate after having children birth.

Secondly, people choose to concentrate on their careers first and then have babies it is because they can take better care of their juveniles. Additionally, they think having children can escalate the expenditures and financial responsibilities of parents. Therefore, they achieve a stable financial position before starting the family as a result this can enable parents to give better education and lifestyle to their children. For instance, parents would be capable of enrolling their juveniles in schools where they get quality education and learn co-circular activities, which are not available in all schools.

However, the drawbacks can not be underestimated. The main problem caused by giving birth later is related to the fertility of both genders. After a certain age, sometimes their fertility rate starts decreasing, due to which they face difficulties in conceiving babies, and pregnant women require special care. To exemplify, studies show that children who are born in later years are often born with some abnormalities, either in terms of physical or mental. Thus, they face problems to survive in this world.

In conclusion, although there are various merits of giving birth to a baby, a single disadvantage is more dangerous for both mother and child as they are sometimes prone to death.","## Task Achievement:

"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What do you think are the reasons for this? Do the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages?","Modern days with the shift of lifestyle and priorities, many prefer to have children at a later age. It is uncommon to see women give birth at the age of 18, usually is after 30 years old. Studies has shown there are several factors contribute to this trend, from higher living standards, different life priorities, and parents choose to be more emotionally prepared. In this essay the factors will be discussed followed with my opinion on this.

As the world develops, living standards have become higher. Consequently, this increases living expense. In order to make sure children gets a decent tertiary education many parents start saving for their children education fund early. This, is only a tip of the ice berg as children will incur other expense such as food, medical, clothes, etc. Adding up all these, many modern young couples have family planning and priorities on reaching stable financial situation before having children. This is an inevitable impact as the economy grows and people try to make more money for a comfortable life.

Secondly, as society becomes more educated, both men and women spend longer time in formal education. By the time university students graduate, they are on average 25 years old. Some of the more ambitious ones will choose to focus on their personal goal or career accomplishment before settling down on forming a family. One thing leads to another, couples choose to get married late will eventually starting the parenthood journey late. 

Another key factor on why people choose to have children late is they prefer to be more matured, emotionally and mentally before their children come along. This is because many view having children as a enormous task in life, it involves a lot of coaching to the young ones and setting their future path correctly. Hence, they prefer to take longer time for preparation.

In summary, there are benefits as well as downsides of having children late. In my opinion, it brings more advantageous as it allows parents to be better prepared in terms of financial and emotional stability. It benefits both the parents and children.","**Task Achievement: 4**

"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What are the reasons? Do the advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","In the contemporary era, most  couples want a baby later in their life. Although it has some flaws, I personally perceive that people not only give preference to make their career first but also want to spend time with each other are the main positive reasons which far surpasses its negatives.

First and foremost, the underlying point associated with the trend of children later in life is that couples give importance to their careers. This is because, partners perceive that settling down first by achieving their goals within deadlines, makes them successful person. After that, they provide a much better life for their future children due to they want a child  later in their life. For example,"" The Times"" published in 2020, mostly all famous personalities follow this trend and have babies later, this also helps their children to live a luxurious life.

Moving on, another worth mentioning favouring attribute is that newly married should have to spend time with each other. To be more specific, new couples try to understand each other by spending quality time together. So that they never face any struggle or misunderstanding in the upcoming future on serious topics. To epitomise, Tim Cooper, from Sheffield Hallam University in the UK, researched and concluded that understanding between couples helps in the growth of children rather than creating issues in front of children.

However, on the contrary, the attributed drawback related to this sometimes twosome have to face consequences for having babies because age affects ,ancestors is said that having a child before 30 years old is best. Despite couples do not have much knowledge, so newly born suffer from myriad issues, so having babies after their 30s is not an issue according to doctors.

In conclusion, children at a later stage are a favourable concept. All the few want earlier, I tend to recommend that after making a successful career. Besides, this mutual understanding between couples plays a vital role for babies later in life. From my perspective, I am certain that its advantages outstrip its disadvantages.","## Task Achievement:

"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What are the reasons? Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","In the present age, the major section of  society has a mindset to conceive a baby after entering  the thirties. People believe that they should first focus on their career and after being successful, they will plan regarding family life. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss  the possible reasons for this thinking and further, I will give valid points as to why having children later in life could possibly lead to disadvantages.

To begin with, the root cause for this mindset is that nowadays, society has money minds and they want to earn a handsome amount of money in the initial stage of their career. For the purpose of earning money, young couples avoid conceiving, because they think that with kids, they will not be able to target  their careers. Furthermore, the young generation like to do social interactive activities by having parties  and going on vacation with friends and they like to enjoy their life like a free bird. But, our generation believes that after having a child, life will not be the same. So, that's why couples avoid having kids at the early stage of marriage. For instance, after a child, you cannot go to late-night parties and you cannot leave him alone at home. So, after having offspring, your whole day revolves around them and you cannot spare time for yourself and it is a valid reason by people do not want to conceive early.

Though  people want to have kids later, there are certain drawbacks to choosing this path. Firstly, after a certain age, the count of sperm decreases and similarly females also start facing hormonal issues due to which sometimes it becomes impossible to give birth to a baby naturally. The second drawback is that when  individual plans to have offspring at a later stage, in this case, the age gap between parents and children increases. Due to this, there is a generation gap among both  generations which leads to clashes between children and parents. 

So, in the end, I would like to conclude that though a career also matters in the individual's life  at the same time, he should also focus on family growth and try to maintain a balance between both roles.","## Task Achievement:

"Nowadays, more and more people decide to have children later in their life. What are the reasons? Do the advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","In my opinion, the given statement stands partially true. Many of the married members of any family, prefer to have children at their early ages. Over the period, the decisions are changed. There could be many reasons for taking such decisions. For example, the raise in the cost of living. Due to increased prices of all the basic needs, people are finding it difficult in raising them, providing them the basic education, and taking care of them.

I believe this is the major reason behind taking such decision. Talking about the advantages and disadvantages, there is a wide scope for advantages being outweighed.

Planning for children after certain period of time, from the marriage day, it gives the couple/family a lot of time, to think about the future. Also in laying a path for their (children) lives. Parents will be able to plan according to their financial status, balancing the requirements. It given an advantage of planning their education, the best institution to chose, and also a strong support with some savings made.

Talking about the disadvantages of having children at early age, it becomes a big challenge in taking up such big responsibility. One should become more stabalized in terms of finance, and ready to spend a lot on education and other expenses.

Being a family of 5 members, with 2 siblings, I really found it very difficult for my parents in rising us. Since, they were not financially stable, and they had to make many debts for providing us all the basic needs like clothes, shelter (rented house), education fee, etc. It took them almost 20 years for them to clear all those debts.

"Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays.

What are the reasons for this?

What can be done to solve this problem?","Recently, it has become notoriously difficult for students to focus on their lessons. In my opinion, this is a partly natural phenomenon that has been exacerbated by technology and the solutions lie in strict restriction and supervision.

The cause of a lack of concentration at school is both the pervasiveness of technology and human nature. Firstly, people have always struggled to focus. Very few pupils enjoy concentrating on tedious lessons and completing endless assignments at the department. However, this has become worse as corporations exploit fundamental human characteristics. Research has shown that the number of hours one spends on a laptop, smartphone, or tablet has a direct correlation with a shorter attention span. The reason for this is that technology supplies passive, immediate gratification. Therefore, schoolkids cannot focus because of a combination of human susceptibility and predatory consumer electronics companies.

The most feasible solutions are for parents and schools to monitor students strictly. This begins with parents. They must either approve or purchase a child their first smartphone or tablet and manage their early interactions with technology. Many parents consciously gift young children these devices to help them learn how to use technology and aid their cognitive development. By waiting until later in life to approve a smartphone or limiting daily screen time, this issue can be greatly mitigated from the onset. Schools also have a role to play as they must enforce strict rules banning the use of smartphones at institutions. For example, in many Asian countries, students' phones are confiscated if they are found using them during classes.

In conclusion, a lack of focus at school is driven by human nature and modern technology, accordingly, parents and schools must work together to curb the worst excesses. Government regulation would also help but should not be expected.","**Task Achievement:**

Many students find it difficult to focus or pay attention at school nowadays. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"Concentrating on lessons is one of the most common problems for a lot of pupils at schools. There are some reasons  why is this happening and also the solutions for them which will be discussed in this essay. 

  The first reason for the absence of concentration are subjects that are taught in a monotonous way. In such case, kids get distracted by other things they bring to school from home. For instance, in our era of technology, even elementary school students have a phone or tablet where there are numerous apps and games. As a result, a child pulls the phone out of his pocket as soon as the lesson gets boring. The solution is for the teacher to engage students in different interactives to better grasp the topics. This method will decrease children’s interest in participating in discussion and hols their attention. 

  Another reason is a teacher’s approach to everyone. Situations, when no attention is paid to some students, occur frequently and as a result, a kid starts doing anything but not listening to the pedagogue. However, if some kids can tell their parents about that type of accident, there are some who does not. Moreover, somebody can even believe it is normal behaviour for a teacher. For instance, some teachers can offend students because they do not meet the standards they imagine in their heads. To tackle this issue, the entire teaching staff ought to attend psychologist sessions before starting to work with children. 

  In conclusion, both problems can be solved if the efforts are made, especially when a person likes the job and is ready to do anything to involve pupils in the process of education.","**Task Achievement:**

"Many people use social media on regular basis in order to keep in touch with the news and with other people.

Do you think that the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?","In contemporary society, social media has consistently been a topic of interest among the masses. The statement that many individuals prefer to choose social media as a tool to communicate with others and read the newest released news presents a viewpoint that is both thought-provoking and debatable. Despite recognizing the merits and drawbacks behind this viewpoint, I am inclined to believe it has more disadvantages, as I believe social media leads to  serious mental health trouble and increases misleading information in society.

It is clear that social media, such as Instagram and Youtube, are platforms with a 24/7, non-stop cycle of news reports and numerous fack and true information just continuously appears on one's pages. The algorithm behind  social media makes people hard to identify which information could be trusted. Furthermore, the news on social media sometimes is full of prejudices and negative emotions, if individuals are not clever enough, it is easy to be misled. It is therefore reasonable that if a person uses social media as the only resource to obtain knowledge is dangerous.

Moreover, the aforementioned perspective does not emphasise the main problems which stem from social media - depression, lack of essential interpersonal communication skills and body shame. Those problems are not only struggling teenagers but also  adults. For example, the texting culture makes people capable of writing reasonable sentences on the internet but afraid of talking in front of others. I believe this is the crucial reason  why so many people suffer from the loneliness epidemic. Such instances support my viewpoint and suggest that addiction to social media leads to mental health and social problems.

In conclusion, given the consideration that social media causes numerous mental issues, lets people leak communication skills, and continuously spreads pessimistic information, my allegiance that using social media as the basic platform to read the latest news and text with others has more drawbacks is steadfastly consolidated and controvertibly firm.","**Task Achievement:** 6.0

In this essay, I will hand down several benefits of using social applications followed by their disadvantages. 

   On the one hand, the main issue with the advantage of using social sites is eliminating the barriers to communication between people caused due to distance. Also, introverts using social networks to link with each other is one of the values that help them in many ways. Moreover, individuals can update themselves with the latest news that has been trending in the world.

Furthermore, it has become increasingly common for people to live a life of technological development; therefore the cybercrime rate has increased significantly in the past few years. For example, recently, some people were robbed by  fake profiles on the internet. There is no doubt that criminals of online theft of personal information are becoming more and more serious consequently these platforms need to be verified to avoid the loss or theft of personal information online.

"Nowadays people use social media to keep in touch with others and be aware of news.
Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages ?","Nowadays, there are numerous platforms available for social networking and to update themselves with the happenings around the world. In my opinion, they should use social sites to connect with different communities around them, but with caution. Further in my essay, I will pen down a few benefits of using social applications, followed by their disadvantages.

To begin with, the primary advantage of using social media is eliminating the communication barrier caused due to distance. Moreover, one can update himself with the latest news that has been trending around the world. Also, getting to know different people globally proves beneficial in exchanging knowledge and different thought process, which assists in widening the perspective. For instance, one of the employment-oriented online services helps connect people with similar interests and gives an insight into various skillsets used across the firms. This can bring like-minded groups closer.

On the contrary, the over abuse of social platforms can lead to loss of valuable time, which otherwise could have been used for productive work. Furthermore, lately, the cybercrime rate has increased tremendously in the past few years. For example, recently, a woman was robbed by a fake profile who claimed to be a bank official. Since the practice of such platforms does not come with identity verification, which means there are high chances of confronting fake profiles.

I believe that the advantages of using social media are more than its disadvantages because it helps exchange knowledge, and the only downside is its uncautious use.

In conclusion, if used cautiously, social media can help find like-minded people. Conversely, it can lead to a severe loss of time and money with continuous irrational use.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people believe that what children watch on television influences their behavior. Others say that amount of time spent watching television influences their behavior. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"People have differing views about the impact of watching TV on children’s behavior. Although watching television can bring certain benefits for our kids, I suppose the disadvantages should not be ignored and this essay will analyze the reasons.

First of all, there are a variety of programs on television, but not all of them are suitable for children. Children tend to mimic what they see on the TV and without parental guidance, they will accidentally watch shows that are inappropriate for them. This will cause the kid to misjudge the information from the shows, they cannot distinguish right from wrong. For instance, when a TV show is broadcasting the violence content, children who saw it will think that action is allowed and they might imitate it. Thus, this could influence a child's behavior and in the worst case scenario, it becomes a start of future crime.  

   Secondly, we cannot discount the effect that screen time has on children, particularly on the physical level. If children are exposed to a TV screen for an excessive amount of time, it will affect their eyesight problems and makes children’s bodies weak due to a lack of physical activities and leads children to a sedentary lifestyle. Not to mention, they can be at risk of certain diseases such as obesity. Additionally, the amount of time letting children watch TV can also negatively affect family relationships. When parents are too busy and their kids are getting noisy and impatient, they tend to use TV as a distraction. As a result, children are lacking in paying attention to everything. The analytical report has defined, when kids are watching a long period of television, it will affect their behavior.

   In conclusion, the behavior of the children will be affected by both type and duration of time of watching television. Therefore, parents should take responsibility for the selection of TV programs and watching time management.","**Task Achievement:**

Task Some people believe that what children watch on television influences their behaviour. Others say that amount of time spent watching television influences their behaviour. Discuss both views and give own opinion,"In this modern times, watching television has become increasingly popular among kids.It is often argued that children's behaviour was effecting by the stuff which they usually watch on tv, whilst others disagree and reckon that it is the amount of time which they spent in front of television.This essay intends to analyse both perspectives.however,I am with the latter view.

To begin with, there is a number of arguments given by those who advocate that kids are influencing by watching tv. today there are a vast number of cartoons and animation available on tv ,which attracts a lot of teenagers . Although these shows and stuff are not real , it still can be able to affect children's behaviour.since they publish various sort of violent scenes such as murder, robbery.,which directly or indirectly impacting kids lifestyle.For example,  recent research of university of manitoba shows that about 80% of teenagers learning different soft of bad stuff by watching tv shows.

On the other hand ,it is also noticeable fact that in today's generation children's watch tv whole day they can live without food but they will not able to spent a day without watching the television.Since many interesting and modern shows and animation available right now .so kids are highly attached with those .For instance, research indicates that around 70%of kids spent their maximum amount of time  watching the television.Therefore,it can be say that this is the main reason why tv affecting teenagers behaviour.

Some people believe that watching television is bad for children. Other people believe that watching television is educational for children. Which opinion do you agree with and why? Give specific details and examples in your answer,"People have different views about whether watching television is educational or harmful for children. While there are some downsides to watching TV for children, I believe that children can learn a plethora of things by watching the right content on the television.

On the one hand, watching TV in excess can have detrimental effects on children. Firstly, watching television for long hours can make children physically feeble and it may affect their eyesight. Secondly, in today’s jet set age most of the families are nuclear and both of the parents are working, so it is possible for the children to get exposed to harmful / inappropriate content. For instance, there is adult content in every movie and sitcom nowadays and also film stars are seen drinking alcohol and doing drugs on television. This could have a detrimental effect on children.

On the other hand, watching TV can be beneficial for learning new things for the children, if they are allowed to watch for limited time and under the supervision of elders. I believe there are numerous channels such as Discovery, National Geographic and Animal Planet which telecast programmes that are educational and thus enhance a child’s cognitive skills. These types of channels broadcast episodes related to science in daily life, flora and fauna, and biodiversity. Children can learn a lot about nature by watching these on the television.

In conclusion, watching TV in excess can be detrimental for children, but I believe that it could be educational if seen if watched for a short amount of time under parental supervision.","## Task Achievement:

More and more people are becoming seriously overweight. Some people think a solution can be to increase the price of fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In this day and age, gaining weight is a global problem. The increasing number of residents are becoming victims of obesity. Some people argue that to solve this situation, it is necessary to go up the expenditure of food which is high in fat. It seems to me that, being overweight is not only by food but also due to human habits. I will shed light on my opinion in the following essay.

On the one hand, there is no denying that pricing fattening foods at a higher cost can demonstrate some effectiveness in reducing the risk of obesity. Firstly, when unhealthy food items become more expensive, people are more likely to reconsider their choices and seek out more nutritious options. For instance, if a bottle of sugary water costs more than a bottle of water, people will choose the latter, thereby reducing their calorie intake. Secondly, this price growth will motivate individuals to reduce the frequency and quantity of purchases, reducing overall consumption and thereby the likelihood of obesity.

On the other hand, other measures with far-reaching impacts should be given greater consideration. Nowadays, a large number of people are leading a sedentary lifestyle which is considered as one of the major reasons for obesity. Therefore, physical exercise plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy body. Besides, participating in counseling sessions with nutrition experts can provide valuable insights into a healthy and balanced diet. For example, by gradually transitioning from fat-heavy to more nourishing food options, individuals can make better-informed choices for their daily diet, leading to a significant decrease in obesity rates over the long run.

In conclusion, it can be argued that while the rise in fattening food prices can be a viable solution to a certain extent, other measures still need to be taken to comprehensively reduce this obesity circumstance","**Task Achievement: 6.5**

The essay adequately addresses the given task by discussing the extent to which increasing the price of fattening foods can be an effective solution to the problem of overweight individuals.

"Some people think news has no connection to people’s lives, so then it is a waste of time to read the news in the newspaper and watch television news programs. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","News from newspapers and TV is really important in our lives. A section of society thinks news does not matter and is a waste of time. While the news is super useful for staying informed, using it the wrong way can have some bad results. The upcoming article will delve into my ideology before making a conclusive stance.

To begin with, news is a vital tool for making people aware and teaching them important things. In other words, news outlets all around the world played a big role in sharing knowledge about the virus, like its symptoms, ways to stay safe, and how vaccines work. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, news was the best way to learn about how the virus was spreading. This information directly influenced how the public acted, making them follow safety rules, get vaccinated, and help fight the virus together. Hence, the news is a crucial way to stay updated about uncertain events worldwide.

Nevertheless, there are some problems with news when it comes to spreading false information. Put differently, news channels might share material that is not true or is made up. They are often in a hurry to be the first ones to tell a story, and that can mean they do not check if the information is right. Also, these platforms can make it so that the public only sees and hears stories and ideas that agree with what they already believe. This can make society more split and stop people from having good conversations. Thus, the spread of false news can lead to confusion, mistrust, and harm to individuals and society.

In conclusion, having engaged in the subject matter, I agree that news is super important for keeping up with what is happening around us. However, we should remember that using it the wrong way can mess up the facts. Therefore, it is imperative to be careful when reading news online and check it from different places to avoid these problems.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people think news has no connection to people’s lives, so it is a waste of time to read news in the newspaper and watch news programs in television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","One of the most conspicuous trends in today's world is a colossal upsurge in few masses think the news has no link to the community's lives, so it is a waste of time to read news in the newspaper and watch news programs on television, thanks to the ubiquity state-of-the-art technology, modernisation and globalisation. There is a widespread worry that this would lead to a myriad of concerns. In my opinion, this apprehension is unwarranted and so should be rejected.

There is a deluge of arguments in favour of my stance. The most preponderant one is that in order to get relaxation, some individuals think the data has no connection to people's lives, so it is a waste of time to read statements in the newspaper and watching advice programs on television plays an essential role in human life. Not only has the modern fast era brought a lot of opportunities all across the globe, but it has also provided various facilities to make our lives comfortable and convenient. Needless to say, all these merits stand in apply good stead, when it comes to broadening their horizons.

Another pivotal aspect of this argument is that in order to deal with this soaring problem government should take effective steps. Which are not remote or complicated but accessible and practicable. Last not but  least, local councils and state authorities should take the necessary initiatives cumulatively.Hence, it is apparent why many are in favour of the above stance.

"Some people think news has no connection to people's lives, so it is a waste of time to read the news in newspapers and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Numerous characters deem watching TV and reading magazines as a wastage of time, as there is no correlation to citizens' lives; meanwhile, certain groups of people oppose and affirm many necessary pieces of information get announced by the news program. I reckon we should not glean a public's daily news from the press, TV, broadcast, and other media. 

First of all, it got proved that affluent people and wealthy politicians give a bribe to media and TV channels to deceive the population for various reasons. If one of the parliament members offends some major crimes, he or she can conceal the offence by using the power of media deluding people, which is a classical way how the press earns. There are countless incidences relating to this in Mongolia. One of these is Tuvshin, a member of parliament congress, who hid successfully the fact that he raped a girl, and stole a large amount of money from the government thanks to the media, which is one example. Hence, it is crucial to do not believe news reported by media.

Secondly, insofar as the objective of the press and webs is to captivate as many readers as possible so that they can make more money. Many websites are posting many numbers of intriguing news, gossips, and other juicy info through the internet and social media every day. For example, you can observe that there are many trashy but juicy posts on Facebook uploaded by websites. Therefore, we have to react perceptively to these uncertain pieces of information.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that taking information from the media is utterly a wrong idea, as they usually provide citizens with fallacious news. Thus, I state again we must not advocate this.","**Task Achievement:**

Paradoxically, others see no relations between news and people’s lives, hence suggesting reading news would be consuming their time. This essay will discuss why I totally disagree with this proposition in terms of educational perspective.

To begin with, the news offers a wealth of general knowledge. Particularly, the phenomenon of watching news program would help people in gaining a comprehensive overview of everyday problems. In fact, people also would have more topics to be discussed in everyday conversation. As a medical practitioner, for instance, by reading updated news in their specialized sector, would bring them expanding and accumulating their knowledge in depth. Thus, by reading and watching a variety of categories news would lead people to bbroaden their mind.  

In addition, shaping reading habit would bring a massive societal advantage. For example, newspaper and TV programs would break the semnsational or bad news to make the incident known. Even though the incidents are not relevant with their lives,yet these would make them aware and the wrongdoings would be lessened due to being condemned by society. As a consequence, society would have more awareness and become more law-abiding people. 

In conclusion, this essay provides numerous benefits of reading or watching the news involving knowledge gaining and social merits.

"Some people think news has no connection to people's lives, so it is a waste of time to read the news in newspapers and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

You should write at least 250 words.","It is often a debatable topic in today's time, where people have started assuming about the irrelevancy of the media and news channels and it doesn't make any sense to be in touch with any of them and therefore, I disagree with the mentioned statement and will demonstrate how print media and news channels are imperative in today's period by updating people with the latest updated news.

Firstly, in my viewpoint, the media play a significant role in today's life. In particular they work as a medium to share and communicate with the people around the world or country through the newspapers we get to know each and everything, whether it is related to education, sports, politics, entertainment, religion, for example, all the current affairs and corruption have been exposed by the media and through print media. For instance, places in India, where many people cant have access to television, so with the help of newspaper media they are able to get information such as recently due to drought in Maharashtra all the peasants and landlords were on strike, cases like a child- abducting, murder, inventions in the country all such news have been reached to the locals through print media which is inexpensive and affordable by everyone.

Secondly, the news channel plays a crucial role to inform and secure data from the various sources. For instance, news channels had helped in informing about novel COVID-19 virus and helped citizens by educating and keeping panel discussion of expertise doctors throughout the world through, which locals got to know more about the virus and safety measures. However, there are at times when fake news or misleading info has been published or shown by the media just for safeguarding a few politicians or well-known people. Still, most of the time they have helped and share insights about the real problems of the country.

"In some cities, people are choosing cars instead of bicycles, while in other cities riding bikes is replacing cars. Why is this the case? Which development do you think is better?","In this present world, people are choosing the suitable transportation tools for them according to specific factors related to their condition. Even if these tools are vehicles or bicycles it does not matter, the financial burden is the master key. I believe that riding bicycles is of paramount importance if it comes to environmental issues and green earth as a future plan.

Firstly, a large sector of people asserts that the economic factor is the main parameter for their transportation when it comes to their selection between cars and bikes. For instance, there are enormous percentages of people using bicycles, especially in developing countries. Moreover, the escalated price of private cars and even gasoline because of world inflation makes the other solution valuable. Hence, it is proven that economic and financial incomes are the main determinants of our lifestyle.

Furthermore, the universal direction toward the environment is to go green. For example, the World Organization for Health conducted a study reveals that earth pollution is accelerated by the usage of petroleum products in transportation. In other words, cars and vehicles have a lot of deleterious carbon emissions which affect the world's sustainability if compared to other machines. Therefore, it is clear that the green world is a direct result of natural resources being used for transportation.

Providing up to six years of free education is the best solution to reduce it so that they can at least read, write and use numbers. I agree with this and we will delve into the reasons in the next paragraphs.

Firstly, it will the nations to make the eco. Providing free learning helps to increase the literacy rate of the country. Nonetheless, it will help the economy in long run. For instance, a survey conducted by a media firm states that 80 per cent of  pupils take schooling seriously and go for further studies. Moreover, in many countries like India, governments are giving free food, books and uniforms to the students and stats suggest that it has helped the country in an economic way.

Secondly, primary learning helps children to develop several skills and abilities. In other words, education will help individuals to grow because they will obtain a better understanding of life and get more knowledge and skills . therefore , pupils  will gain financial stability  in the future because they may have the possibility to land a good job and a high-paying salary.

Historical objects should be brought back to their country of origin. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many contend that historical assets should be returned to the country they originated from. While I partially concur with this opinion, it should not be a universal rule.

Proponents of the return of these relics point to their historical importance. This can be explained through the hypothetical scenario of Japan discovering a diary written by Ho Chi Minh during his stay there on his journey to seek national salvation. As the Japanese are generally unfamiliar with this historical figure, the diary possesses minimal relevance to them and limited commercial value for local public display institutions. It naturally should be repatriated to Vietnam, where Ho Chi Minh is revered as their greatest leader. Vietnamese historians would gain valuable insights into his revolutionary journey through the diary, and the museum exhibiting it would attract more visitors eager to witness his handwriting and explore the accompanying narratives.

However, there are also historical objects that do not require repatriation. For example, after the Vietnam War, the United States withdrew the majority of its military weaponry, a part of which would already suffice for reutilization for exhibition and other purposes. It is therefore unnecessary to reclaim the American tanks currently on display at the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City. These foreign exhibits have long been the essence of the museum, drawing numerous visitors, enabling them to experience the war more authentically, and inspiring them to learn history. This, coupled with the substantial costs concerning specialized approaches to transporting such large, rusted vehicles to the United States, justifies their retention in Vietnam.

In conclusion, origin should not be the sole driver of historical artifact repatriation. Other factors, such as delivery expenses and the specific needs and interests of each country involved, should also be taken into account.","**Task Achievement:**

Historical objects should be brought back to their country of origin. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Historical objects are precious items that carry immense cultural and historical significance. They offer valuable glimpses into the past and act as tangible connections to our ancestry and heritage. According to a belief, it is crucial to repatriate these valuable treasures and preserve them in their original homeland. In this essay, I will elaborate on my strong agreement with this notion and shed light on my support for this subject.

Primarily, artefacts carry significant historical and cultural value for the people of a nation. For instance, the Koh-I-Noor diamond, once part of India's rich heritage, is now housed in the United Kingdom's Crown Jewels collection. Returning the Koh-I-Noor to India would be a meaningful gesture, as it holds deep cultural and historical importance for the Indian people. Consequently, it would allow them to reconnect with their past and preserve a piece of their heritage for future generations.

Furthermore, repatriating historical objects can play a crucial role in strengthening the nation's identity and pride. For example, The Sultan Ganj Buddha, an ancient bronze statue discovered in Bihar, is currently displayed in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in the United Kingdom. Returning the Sultan Ganj Buddha to India would be an opportunity to celebrate and appreciate Indian history and spirituality. Hence, having artefacts back in their original context could help  people develop a deeper understanding of their culture and traditions.

In conclusion, having engaged in the subject matter, while displaying the artefacts in foreign museums may offer educational benefits to people worldwide, we should consider the special significance of these objects to the people of their nation. Therefore, I strongly support the idea that historical objects should be bought back to their country of origin as it can help preserve the rich heritage and foster a stronger sense of national identity and pride.","**Task Achievement:**

More and more people are seriously overweight. some people suggest the solution to this problem is to increase the prise of fastening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree,"It cannot be denied that today more and more people are seriously overweight. Some people suggest the solution to this problem is to increase the costs of  fattening foods. I definitely disagree with this statement. 

I think that increasing the price of  fattening foods is not the solution to this issue. From the way  I think, the solution to this problem is organizing a lot of sports centres and other places where people can do physical activities. Because there are many villages in our country that do not  have sports centres.  Another solution would be attracting people to a diet that is useful for our health. 

Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, I will argue that stout people  are in need of art. For instance, in film, we must see them. The film is not nice without them. However, being overweight can cause serious illnesses. For this reason, people should avoid it. Being thin can cause serious diseases too. So I can say that increasing the price of  fattening foods is not a solution.

Some people outweigh others because of illness. Nevertheless,they want to eat that food.

Way of my conclusion, I reiterate my position that  increasing the costs of fattening foods is not the solution to this issue. However, I am concerned that the steps mentioned above would be helpful. This is such a complex problem that I do not believe any other solution will be found in the near future. From my perspective, one of the most important methods to resolve this problem is increasing sports centres in many parts of the country.","**Task Achievement: 5**

More and more people are seriously overweight. Some people suggest the solution to this problem is to increase the price of fattening foods.

In my perspective, I compeletly agree with this settling and reckon that enlarging fatty diet cost will be a perfect completion.

Firstly, the huge amount of fast-food restaurants that sell their product with affordable price so that people more interested to buy their dishes. In fact, this kind of food contain large amount of fat. Even though most of people know about this reality, it is not going to make them to stop buy lardy diets because of  the fascinating deals in terms of the cost. In addition, most of their customers are from students with limited monthly allowance so this kind of food is preferable for them. So it is one of the reason why escalating its cost is reliable.

Secondly, the consumers of fattening foods are those who not concern about healthy lifestyles and consider food based on its appearance. Nevertheless sweet foods that contain a lot of carbohydrates such as cakes, chocolate breads and high quality chocolates are not preferable by most of people, it is because of the high charge. So people will tend to buy the other meals that having good appearance but with more thrifty price like sweet potatoes.

Therefore, some people think that newspapers are the best way to get news. However, others believe that they can get news better through other media platforms. Personally, I agree with both of view and give the reason below. 

First and for most, newspapers are suitable for most senior citizens. Because they have a habit of reading a newspaper every day. And it is difficult for them to change a habit.

Young people are often influenced in their behaviours and situations by others in the same age. This is called “peer pressure”. Do the disadvantages of peer pressure outweigh the advantages?,"It is quite common these days that the young are much influenced by peer pressure. It is my belief that the positive effects of this phenomenon could certainly offset its disadvantages. 

There are several drawbacks to peer pressure. A common reason is that young people’s mentality is negatively affected, which can lead to worry or depression. In fact, working or studying with better students can make young people uncomfortable. For example, when I study in a class with a lot of classmates who learn much better than me, I feel very pressured and ashamed. Another negative aspect can be that the youth often feel uncomfortable with their appearance. This means that if peers just pay attention too much attention to appearance and make judgments, young people can feel uneasy and try to be as  fashionable as possible, which can be very costly.

However, in spite of these negative effects, peer pressure can bring about important benefits. One obvious advantage is that young people have opportunities and environments to develop themselves better. In fact, if young people are surrounded by good people, they can learn from them such as trying anything new or discovering new ideas to help them overcome some difficult problems. For example, my colleagues in my brother’s company work productively and solve problems quickly; therefore, my brother day by day works more effectively and productively, and he has just been promoted to manager. 

In conclusion, it’s common that young people are often influenced in their behaviours and situations by peers. While this can make them sometimes stressed, there can be a lot of benefits in helping young people to have  motivation to grow and succeed.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","There is an opinion that employers should not overly concern themselves with what their employees wear, as their quality of work should be the primary focus. I wholeheartedly agree with this viewpoint, and this essay will elaborate on my reasons.

The major consideration for employers should indeed be the quality of their employees' work. When employers prioritize work performance over dress code, they create an environment where employees can focus on their tasks without unnecessary distractions. For example, in the tech industry, companies like Apple have adopted a more relaxed dress code, allowing employees to wear casual attire. This approach has contributed to a culture of innovation, where employees feel comfortable and empowered to generate groundbreaking ideas. By emphasizing work quality over attire, companies like Apple have demonstrated that allowing employees to dress comfortably can lead to enhanced creativity and productivity.

Furthermore, an excessive focus on dress codes can negatively impact inclusivity and diversity within the workplace. When employers impose strict dress codes, they may inadvertently exclude employees from various cultural backgrounds who have unique clothing preferences or requirements. For example, in multinational corporations with employees from diverse cultures, mandating a Western dress code might alienate those who prefer traditional attire. Embracing a more flexible dress code policy fosters an inclusive environment where employees from different cultural backgrounds feel respected and valued, contributing to a more harmonious and diverse workplace.

In conclusion, employers should place their main focus on the quality of their employees' work rather than micromanaging their attire. As exemplified by companies like Apple and multinational corporations, this approach not only enhances work performance but also fosters an inclusive and diverse working environment.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work. To what extent do you agree or disagree","In this modern workplace, the trend of dress codes is changing as employers focus more on results than rules that employees must follow. Although I agree that people should dress formally in some professional settings, there is no one-size-fits-all answer for every industry.

On the one hand, professional attire plays a key role in certain professions, such as the hospitality industry, and healthcare sectors, to name but a few, which is considered a must for many jobs. For example, clients are able to recognize waiters or waitresses at a hotel by clothing, thus facilitating work procedures and saving time and effort. The uniform is also a norm among soldiers and police officers, which can not only make them easily identified but signalize the image of authority and trustworthiness. Furthermore, formal wear is usually required on some occasions to show our respect and professionalism to others. For instance, interviewees should put on office attire in the meeting, thereby impressing interviewers with professional attitudes. 

On the other hand, the uniform may deprive us of creativity and the pursuit of freedom, which should not be de rigueur in all contexts. It is par for the course for employees working in high-tech companies to wear casually. After all, they do not need to serve customers face-to-face or present seriousness to others. More importantly, dress codes should not steal the show in the workplace, instead, they must place high emphasis on the work results. Furthermore, with the increasing number of people working at home and becoming self-employed, it is unnecessary to regulate subordinates what to wear at work. 

In conclusion, while business clothes should not reign supreme in all businesses, it is still the order of the day in many professions according to professional settings and requirements.","### Task Achievement:

Young people are often influenced in their behaviours and situations by others in the same age. This is called “peer pressure”. Do the disadvantages of peer pressure outweigh the advantages?,"It is true that peer pressure has been a phenomenon, defining the influence of young people on their friends of the same age. In my view, its disadvantages do not outweigh the advantages. 

To begin with, peer pressure brings numerous disadvantages. One of the undeniable reasons is the career comparison among people, which became popular nowadays. The fact that some could become successful early and others may not due to the difference in their chosen majors; therefore, having a career compared is not a good idea that might get us uncomfortable. A good example of this is the rate of depression in the youth, some feel stressed out while being involved in comparing with others’ success. 

In addition, young people could copy the bad habits of churlish friends such as smoking or drinking wine too much; from that, effecting negatively on their health. 

Despite having limitations, peer pressure actually has some significant benefits, which would be a good friendship. It is true that everyone needs someone with whom to share  happiness and sorrows. Furthermore, young persons can learn vital skills such as leadership or good communication by encouraging each other. Therefore, it is a great way to help in sorting out difficulties in their life and develop their career together. This is particularly the case for the Nobel prize, many people working together to achieve the title is better than acting alone. 

In short, I advocate that although peer pressure has both pros and cons, we should consider its advantages to live comfortably while eliminating any unnecessary limitations with no doubt.","**Task Achievement:**

There are myriad advantages of such influence. To initiate with, the knowledge and experience they gain by each others company. To explain it more i would say that, every child needs someone with whom they can share their happiness and sorrows and if, they are their friends they feel more comfortable with them to share anything.
Moreover, They can learn an important life skill by encouraging each others like, good communication skills and leadership skills and this helps them in shorting out many difficulties in their life.


Despite having many Benefits of peer pressure, it has some limitations too.
To begin with the adoption of bad habits, If any young  child is influenced by the person of his age who smoke and drink, they may also involve in that bad habits. Furthermore, Inspiring wealthy people also creates inequality in person's life. For instance, if youngsters are encouraged by rich people there may be a chance that they demand for the expensive gifts from their parents, which they could not afford.

"In some countries, celebrities complain about the way the media publicizes their private lives. Some people say that they should accept it as part of their fame.

Therefore, some famous individuals make a complaint to the media in order to have their boundary. Some people insist that they have to admit this phenomenon as part of their fame. However, I strongly dissagree with this opinion. This is because famous people have a right to have private space in their life and they might be a victime by criminals. 

To begin with, emient people have a right to have their own space in their daily live. In fact, everyone needs their private room where they can be protected by externel factors including famous people. Having a boundary plays a pivotal role in people's live.

They protest to media companies to stop posting their life in order to tackle this problems. Sometimes, they have medicines or conduct sessions to deal with their stress. Moreover, This situation might lead their fandoms to have a sense of worries and a lot of entertainment companies to lose their assests as a prominent people in our society.

They are more likely to invade eminent people's daily live by following their schedules every single day and taking a majority of pictures. Sometimes, they even attack celebrities physically. For example, there was a serious crime in China. One of prominent actress, named Wan Wei was captured by a stoker. The criminal said that he was able to check her lives by watching media news all the time. This means that too much information about celebrities' life might cause deterimental situation for them such as stoking, captures and so on.

"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree.","It's argued that schools should pay more attention to students' academic success in exams instead of teaching cooking, sewing and crafting skills as they can be acquired from relatives and friends. This essay strongly disagrees with the opinion because these skills support a well-rounded education for all students and can contribute to a stable income in the future.

It's undeniable that culinary, sewing or wood-making classes make up a well-rounded education for students besides the traditional academic subjects. In the learning process of these skills, pupils can apply knowledge from other classes and take on numerous soft skills. For example, learning about culinary can help combine a myriad of information from biology into understanding how different food combinations affect our bodies, practice making meal plans and prepare healthy dishes on their own.

Another reason for my disagreement is that we're experiencing the rising number of unemployed people due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the global financial crisis. Therefore, students who are able to excel in numerous skills can help a student have more diverse career paths and ensure a continuous source of income without depending on a sole job. For instance, after being laid off in their 30s, a couple in China recently became an Internet sensation for utilizing their cooking skills to successfully change their positions from software developers to street food merchants. 

In conclusion, this essay strongly disagrees with the belief that schools should only focus on students' academic success instead of teaching them life skills such as cooking or crafting. The reason is that these subjects add up to a well-rounded education for the students and can ensure them a more stable income in the future.","**Task Achievement:** 7

"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends.

From my perspective, I strongly believe that this statement is correct, but I will be explaining both points of view with the support of some relevant examples.

To commence with, schools should focus mainly on the studies of the students. Providing them with better education,  is the main objective that the parents send their children to school. This helps them to get better remarks in the examinations, which help them to improve their academic background. In addition to this, students with  excellent academic records may receive  better job opportunities in future as compared to  other people. For  instance, there are many countries with parents who want their children to be a doctor or an engineer, instead of chefs or fashion designers. This kind of fields can only be achieved if the children focus more on their studies and examinations instead of some other activities. Even there are few guardians or parents who suggest that the school should provide sports activities instead of some extracurricular activities.

In contrast to this, students and their parents prefer that school should have some other skills aside from the subjects and examinations, such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork. This helps them to develop their resume stronger and opens many industrial opportunities. Let's assume that the school have some other activities such as cookery, this will help the student to grow their foundation if he or she wants to be a chef.

To conclude, schools should provide some  other extracurricular activities but should not make them mandatory for every student to learn them. This will help students  achieve whatever goal they want to achieve.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that governments should change the way individuals live, while others believe they should choose the way themselves. Discuss these both points of view and give your opinion?","Children from a rich family background do not deal well with the hardships in adult life in comparison with those who have a mediocre family background during their childhood days. I completely agree with this idea and opinion because the children from a poor family have good time management skill and also have a better emotional quotient in life.

Firstly,these children with less money tend to be happy with what they have at present and so do not expect a lot from their parents.Moreover, they do not live in a big house or a mansion with separate rooms but live in a small hut . Despite of these poor facilities they live happily with their family without complaining about them. For example, the children without a lot of money travel mostly by bicycle and public transports from their childhood, so they would not find it difficult to travel in their adult life compared to the wealthy children.

The next important reason for me to agree with this opinion is that they are better with time management and money management skills. These children help their parents to overcome the financial burden by doing  local errands for money which help them to manage time in adult life.For instance, perhaps during their childhood days they help their parents with the household work , after they are finished with school.Furthermore, middle class children tend to work part time in their neighbourhoods to help their family financially.

In conclusion , children with a middle class background have better management skills which are crucial for facing adult life.Unlike the children with wealthy parents , they have a better emotional stability to deal with the problems of adulthood.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that it is better for older schoolchildren to study a large number of subjects and develop a wide range of knowledge. Others argue that they should study a smaller number of subjects and focus on details. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Over the past decade, by virtue of advanced living standards, the educational system has gained popularity in various countries, leading to a paradigm shift in the application of multiple subjects at schools. This, therefore, is believed to be beneficial for learners. Despite the many positive ramifications that may derive from the argument, this educating style is likely to be predominantly disadvantageous to students due to the rationales outlined below. 

Admittedly, advocates of the statement that adolescent students should better learn a variety of subjects at schools may argue that this implementation not only offers learners many useful skills but also enables a foreseeable well-rounded individual. First, when attending to some intellectual subjects, namely chemistry or math, students are able to enhance their cognitive abilities. Some examples of this, particularly include the improvement of problem-solving skills like balancing chemical equations or addressing chemical reactions. Second, since a multi-subjects educating style is implemented, this necessitates a well-developed citizen. By studying many majors at schools, students might get a deeper insight into every aspect of life, leading to a complete understanding of their future.

Nevertheless, despite the feasible positive impacts above, focusing on some chosen subjects is still the optimal choice. First, favorite majors act as incentives for youngsters’ passion and motivation in learning. It should be remembered that once adolescents are encouraged to engage in the fields they are interested in, they will have opportunities to foster their talents and potential abilities themselves, therefore minimizing teachers’ efforts in terms of helping learners understand the lessons. In addition, once students can select their favored subjects, a self-learning style will be granted. If young learners can make a decision on what they will study, their independence and autonomy skills in learning will be ensured, leading to a responsible individual later on. 

In conclusion, despite the ubiquity of multi-subject avenues in education, prioritizing several selected subjects remains the most preferred choice due to the autonomic and favorable features. Because of these merits, I do expect government development aims to be drastically altered in the foreseeable future.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that robots are important for humans’ future development. Other think that robot have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Artificial intelligence and mechanical electronics have been the core of contemporary advancement. Robotics is now a field that is not unknown and the spike, we are seeing in its implementation is something huge. Today, robots are present everywhere whether it is at home as your cleaner and vacuum or in the operation theatre as surgeons' assistants. However, the opinions on it are quite the opposite. Some believe that it is the best invention in the history of mankind while some believe otherwise. I opine that its benefits are weighed higher on the scale as compared to its drawbacks

To begin with, robots have taken the world by storm through the outcome and  their performance. The first and foremost advantage is it has never been so easy to solve complex problems as it is today. robots have the innate ability to do various tasks together and to provide accurate answers. Secondly, they are now sharing the workload of human beings by performing various levels of  work thus providing them with  a sense of relaxation. For instance, many surgeries are now performed by Da Vinci which is a specialized robot to assist surgeons and in this way, half of the burden has been reduced.

On the other side, there are drawbacks that should be taken into consideration. One of them is the industry will soon be converted into an AI-driven workforce and as a ,result millions of people will be jobless as e!employers will prefer this one-time investment instead of paying an amount every month to the employee. Another thing that is alarming is the lack of power to change decisions timely. These electronics work on the installed and manufactured intelligence therefore they do not have the capability to switch their mode according to circumstances. For example, if a robot is teaching a class that is not disciplined, it has no power to process how to keep children motivated.

In conclusion, I would like to say that in spite of a few deficiencies, it is going to help human beings in great ways in the near future . All we need to understand is that these creatures can take up our responsibilities but can never give us  emotional support. So, use the robots but stay connected to the people","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that robots are important for human’s future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science and engineering to design machines that can help and assist human beings. A stratum of society opines that automation of tasks by robots is a positive development for the future whereas another section believes that this would bring some negative impact on the society.

On the one hand, cost effectiveness, improved quality assurance, increased productivity etcetera are the major advantages of employing robots in real life. The cost of investment to purchase a robot can be recovered in a relatively short space of time as the they will not avail any lunch breaks, holidays or sick leaves unlike the regular employees. The decline in concentration levels due to repetitive tasks for a long time found in human beings are not observed in the case of robots. In addition to that, automated robots can be exposed to toxic and hazardous environment like nuclear power stations, rigs and mines were human body is vulnerable to potential injuries caused by various chemicals and radiations.

On the other hand, one of the biggest concerns surrounding the introduction of robotic automation is the impact of jobs for workers. With the advancement in machine learning and artificial intelligence, industries have introduced robots to automate tasks were no human intervention is required. This has caused a sudden decrease in need of human employees to perform the same task resulting in unemployment. Furthermore, robots run on a specific algorithm designed for it and are not ready for unforeseeable situations like hacking. For instance, if these automated machines are used in banking systems then there are possible chances of accounts getting hacked leading to various fraudulent activities. 

To summarise, the advancement of robots is unquestionably a positive development in a variety of fields such as medicine, factories, manual labour, and many others, but the algorithm on which they operate must be fully secure and equipped with the most up-to-date devices in order to reduce the risk of hacking, fraud, and malfunction.","**Task Achievement:** (3.5)

Some people think that robots are important for human’s future development. Others think that robots have negative effects on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In recent years, humans are heavily adapted to advanced technologies and it has become an integral part of life. Robots are considered to be one of the greatest innovations of mankind. Certain individuals believe that they are harmful to humans while some stratum of society argue that they are crucial for the future. I personally believe that robotics is a positive development for the world.

To begin with, some people assert that these techno-savvy machines can endanger human life. This is because robots are not emotionally intelligent to distinguish what set of operations are right or wrong; which can have a detrimental effect. To illustrate, a recent accident involving a Telsa electric car that killed two people points fingers at its autonomous driving feature. Moreover, these robots running on a specific algorithm are in the early stage of development that can be exposed to hacking. For instance, if these machines are employed in the banking sector, there is a high probable chance of account hacking and other fraudulent activities. 

On the other hand, benefits derived from the invention of robots are significant for the development of the future. Most importantly, these automated machines can be deployed in places that are hazardous to humans. For example, a robot called Mini-Manbo has become the central part of the cleaning-up process in the damaged Fukushima reactor, where it is dangerous for humans to execute these tasks. Additionally, the heavy automation by robots in the automobile industry and hazardous chemical plants has reduced stress on employee’s health and increased productivity and precision in these sectors.

In conclusion, although, some argue that robots can be potentially life-threatening and cannot be considered safe to be employed in various industries such as banking, I strongly believe that they can bring a positive change for the future.","## Task Achievement:

How can we solve this problem?,"Many primary and secondary education students are find it challenging to focus on lectures at their educational institutes. This essays discusses the causes of this development and also suggests ways to resolve them.

Many pupils cannot maintain concentration at schools because some of those may have exisiting medical conditions, while it is also likely their daily routine is inconducive for learning. I was suffering from ADHD, attention deficit hyperactive syndrome, which is known to distract students easily who often complain about their inability to lose focus for prolonged period of time. Hence, I believe that it is possible that such syndrome may be undiagnosed in many disciplines, which could explain their lacking power of concentration. As well as this, habits that are disruptive, such as playing excessive hours on video gaming and spending less time in outdoor active, also contribute to this problem.

However, this challenge can be overcome by increasing awareness. Parents need to be aware any underlying medical conditions so that its repercussions could be averted. Therefore, the government can use public infomercials to educate the parents about any health conditions that could undermine their children' ability to concentrate. As well as this, an information broadcast aimed at enlightening fathers and mothers about the benefits of exercising and supervising children's screen time, , such as watching cartoons and digital games, could mitigate the problem. For example, playing outdoors not only increases dopamine but also increases alertness.

Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to school. What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"It is true that many children find it difficult to focus on the course at school. There are many reasons behind this phenomenon, so we need to take a comprehensive approach to mitigate it.

On the one hand, several factors contribute to this aissue. One of the reasons is the development of technology such as the applications of smartphones. With smartphones, many students are addicted to the virtual world brought about by mobile games and gain a sense of achievement

, which cannot be found in schools. The influence of the environment is another main reason. For example, if the juveniles around them behave badly in schools like talking to others or sleeping in classes without being punished by teachers, which may have a bad impact on them and they may imitate this behaviour, leading to their lack of focus on their school work.

However, many measures can be taken to solve this problem. To begin with, parents can take children to do some outdoor activities such as kite flying and hiking. They are good ways for juveniles to get close to nature and be away from the virtual world. Then the children may understand the beauty of the real world. Furthermore, improving teaching quality is also important, which means teachers can make their teaching content more abundant to increase the opportunity for interaction with students. For instance, teachers should introduce more entertaining activities in classes such as brainstorming and group discussions. By doing so, the minors can focus more on the course at schools.

In conclusion, the development of technology and the influence of the environment are the main reasons why it is difficult for students to catch the course at school, but actions should be taken along several aspects through doing outdoor activities and heightening teaching quality.","**Task Achievement:** 6.5

Children find it difficult to pay attention or concentrate on school study what are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"In recent times, we can see most children cannot pay attention to their academic studies across the globe. There are several reasons for this phenomenon, and we need to find some solutions in order to mitigate this problem.

First of all, the main reason for the difficulty to pay to concentrate on a university education is a lot of pressure, which is being faced by most individuals. In addition, internal competition in school is not only the main factor for this but the school syllabus is also creating a lot of burden on young minds. Further, the number of home works, which is not necessary for the heir, has been increased by institutions indeed. Moreover, some colleges do not have any sports facilities where kids and adults can spend some time relaxing both psychologically and physically. For instance, as per a recent survey on academic training centres, 60 per cent of colleges and schools are not at all providing any infrastructure services in the academy, and management of the training institutions are just focused on  academic performance only. 

On the other hand, there are some steps, which need to be taken in order to solve this problem. Firstly, institute staff are not only  responsible for kids but scion's parents also must  take equal measures for their children's growth. Secondly, enforcement agencies should focus on academic centres' activities and conduct some drills in every school. Thirdly, both teachers and parents create awareness of individuals and get information from people, and what are the main reasons behind the lack of concentration on institutional studies. For instance, some developed nations are focusing on only students' intellectual skills than focusing on their grades. Indeed,  implementing this practice across the country will lead best results and  pressure on students will be reduced eventually.

Many customs and traditional ways of behaviors are no longer relevant to the modern life and no worth keeping. Do you agree or disagree?,"Some people argue that many traditional customs and behaviours have been updated in the modern world and should be abandoned. However, I completely disagree with this point of view and believe those traditional customs deserve to be kept.

The main reason why most traditional customs are worth keeping is that they are still useful in the modern world. While some traditional customs including unconditionally following policies made by the king have been replaced by the democratic political system, there are still quite some traditional customs that adapt well to modern society. For example, people in east asian countries are still used to shaking hands when they meet new friends or business partners, which has been followed for more than 1000 years and is still a great way to help quickly establish friendship or business cooperation. Consequently, those kinds of traditional customs should be kept.

Another important reason for keeping certain traditional customs and behaviours is that they are essential records of human history. For instance, in the Western world, people celebrate Christmas and in many countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia such as China and Vietnam, people celebrate Lunar New Year, which gathers family members together and reminds people of the history of their ancestors. These traditional customs have built a bridge between modern civilization and ancient history, which is a priceless treasure in human beings’ history. Therefore, it is important to preserve some traditional customs.

In conclusion, although some outdated traditional customs deserve to be abandoned in the modern world, I firmly believe that some traditional customs are vital parts of human history and are still applicable in modern society and thus should be kept.","## Task Achievement:

"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. 

What are the causes of this?

What actions can be taken to solve this problem?","Over the past few decades, the increasing number of vehicles, both private and public, has become an issue in many parts of the world, especially in urban areas. In my opinion, there are two key reasons behind this situation, and several solutions could be effective to deal with it. 

Regarding the causes, it may come from  overpopulation and the breakthrough in technology which encourages people to travel more. The very first rationale is about the higher total of inhabitants in many areas around the globe. Indeed, the world population has reached eight billion citizens recently. The more humans, the more vehicles are needed. To satisfy their demand for travelling and commuting, people have a tendency to afford their own transport, such as a car or a motorbike, which allows them to move at their convenience. The growth in the number of vehicles  on roads, however, has been responsible for air and noise pollution in metropolises. For example, Dehli, one of the most inhabited megacities, is famous for not only its authentic traditions but also the poorest quality of air which is covered with overwhelming exhaust fumes from private transportation all year round. Another reason that needs consideration is the development of mobile technology. Such achievements make travelling much easier than ever before. Visiting a foreign city is now in hand thanks to the investment in air travel. Nevertheless, this  can cause some disruption and annoyance in the local areas where the airports are constructed. 

The aforementioned issues may be addressed with two possible methods. First of all, there should be a nationwide regulation to control the number of childbirths. Like China, its one-child policy 20 years ago is now efficient to reduce and keep the number of its locals under supervision. Fewer car users have encouraged lower use of transport. Besides, public transport ought to receive more investment. The national budget can be spent to purchase more buses, build more railways and train more staff to meet the growing needs of travellers. When passengers can enjoy their trip in a subway, obviously, not many people desire to buy and maintain a car anymore.

In conclusion, overcrowding and new technology are loaded in favour of the transportation on roads. The mentioned ways may be taken into consideration to solve this problem.","## Task Achievement:

What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","There are lots of vehicles in every part of the world creating unbearable traffic is now a burning issue globally. This eaasy will explain some reasons for this problem and suggest few solutions.

First of all, every humans are so much busy these days either with there studies or with there jobs.

So, to comfort their daily life they travel in their private vehicle for example: car, bike and so on. They barely use public transportation. However, if these people start using public vehicles such as buses, trains, etc., then the issue of traffic would be solved.

Further, I am also conviced that the population of many nations are not aware about the effects of heavy traffic. This is why pupils are buying branded cars and motercycles for each member of the family not only to survive comfortably but also to show off. So, to make people alert about this danger government should conduct awareness programmes for instance: performing road drama, mass discussion, health education explaining the diseases (lungs and skin diseases) that can arise due to pollutions (air and sound pollution) and many more. 

To sum the above statements, people uses their own vehicle to comfort their daily living and also because they are not aware of its conscequences.

"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem.
what are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","Traffic congestion is becoming a global problem and, in some arias this lead to a major drow back of the economy. Most of the time, rising urban population and shooting level of private vehicles on road are the main problem but, improper development of the roads is a rising cause . Although the development of proper road system and introduction of good public transport facility among the main solution , we can't forget about the development of small towns to prevent migration of their population. In the following essay, I will discuss  these matters in detail.

Firstly, when we consider about reasons for roadblocks in major cities , the high level of urban community is a major factor. Apart from that, when the living condition of people improvs , eventually they buy private vehicles resulting, In rising traffic on roads. When  people use an improperly planned locomotion network , their probability of traffic on rods will rise without a doubt. for example . in Sri Lanka , most of the traffic congestion occurs around Colombo city  where  more people live , work and study. 

Secondly , when we consider  the solution for this traffic congestion , improvement of the quality and number of public transport facilities is more important. apart from this, the road system should be well organised and properly maintained. most importantly , the development of the country should be spread to both urban and rural arias of the country to prevent local migration of people. For instance , a study was done by one of the universities in Sri Lanka suggest improving facilities in less developed cities in the country to prevent the expansion of the urban population and improve public transport facilities like trains and buses to prevent rising traffic congestion in major cities like Colombo and Kandy.

 In conclusion, principal reasons for expanding traffic in most major center around the globe are rising urban community , expanding private vehicles on the avenue and poor quality pathway network . As a prevention strategy , the introduction of luxurious public shipping facilities , upgrading the quality of the road network and versatile  advancement towards the rural arias can be proposed.","**Task Achievement:**

"In cities and towns all over the world the high volume of traffic is a problem. 


What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?","Traffic congestion is a serious issue in many parts of the world. This is because of the poor infrastructure of the roads and lack of proper public transports .Improving the public transport systems and proper connectivity of roads will solve the issue to some extent.

One  main reason for high traffic jams is that roads are not properly connected and narrow lanes of the main roads of the cities.Most of the working-class people, as well as school children, start their day at the same time.If there are no flyovers,underground bridges or additional lanes,traffic gets concentrated at the same place.Moreover,insufficient lanes for many vehicles to pass through at the same time increase the problem.Furthermore,many cities have not improved public transport systems forcing people to take personal vehicles.For instance,even if each member of a family takes their vehicle for work then traffic problems aggravate.These are the reasons for a high volume of traffic jams in the developed part of the world.

The main solution for overcoming this issue is to increase connectivity  in roads.Constructing fly-over bridges,underground passages will help in diverting traffic to a certain level.Additional by-lanes connecting the main road also divert traffic present on the main roads.Another solution is upgrading public transport systems at regular intervals in the urban areas.Government should increase local buses in the routes where traffic jam is seen the most.Also,new forms of transport like over-head metro rails do make a big difference in reducing the volume.For example,Dubai,one of the busiest cities in the world constructed Dubai metro rail as an answer to their traffic woes.These solutions help in overcoming traffic jam issues to a large extent.

"In some cities and towns all over the world, the high volume of traffic is a problem. 
What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem.","The hiking traffic congestion is a growing concern for many cities nowadays. The main reasons for this includes, decrease use of public transport and a lack of alternative means of travelling or mass transit projects. There are various measures that can prove effective in this regard.

The unpopularity of public transportation is one of the main reasons that is causing traffic jams and transportation problems in various metropolitan cities of the world. Either non-availability or substandard public transport encourages public to use their personal vehicles that results in traffic issues, particularly during peak hours. A lack in alternative transportation methods like the underground subways, trams and trains are yet another contributory factor that urges people to use their self owned transports causing a considerable choking of the roads.

There are various steps that can be taken at both the government and individual level to fight this growing issue. Firstly, the most instantaneous results can be sought if the government encourages people to use public transport by making it more comfortable, convenient and cost effective. In other words, if the quality public transportation is made available to the citizens that is parallel to their personal cars in comfort, yet at a lower cost, can encourage people to prefer using public transport. For example, the public in the European countries prefers to use public transport rather than using one of their own because it is equally good and more affordable.

 Secondly, another factor that can be of great value in the long term, is to minimize the traffic congestion is by constructing the alternate means of transit. Since cities are expanding due to urbanization, it has resulted in the shrinkage of roads that are not enough to meet the transport requirement of a relatively bigger population. Hence there is a need to build alternate roads, ring roads, subways or rail tracks to divert the influx and avoid traffic jams. For instance, the construction of a new ring road around Lahore, the provincial capital of Punjab, Pakistan has resulted in negligible transport issues that used to be a big problem in the past.

To conclude, encouraging public transportation and constructing the alternative transportation methods are the few solutions that can help in solving the growing issue of traffic congestion. It is therefore suggested that the authorities should focus on taking these measures in order to combat the traffic problems effectively.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people think parents should read or tell stories to children. Others think parents needn’t do that as children can read books or watch TV, movies by themselves. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Some people argued that there is no need for parents to read stories since children can help themselves with reading and watching videos. While I understand that there are difficulties for busy fathers and mothers, I believe storytelling is a great measure to help offspring's development.

First and foremost, the company of the guardians help preschoolers build their sense of security. It is essential for little ones to feel secure in order to further other ability towards socialisation. Neglected babies, for example, are proved to have emotional control and communicational problems in their adulthood. In addition, regular daily schedules, such as bedtime stories, assist young children's brain development and reduce the tension from the environment. Similarly, parents could better bond their descendants by spending time together reading.

On the other hand, even though small kids are fond of video clips, these media hamper their abilities of imagination and discourage the stimuli of verbal and interpersonal skills. Online free youtube content, which is evident especially, often created only for catching views' eyes for clicks rather than educational information. Although pupils could improve word capacity by reading books themselves, it becomes thorny when young learners forgo their connections with families and lose their motivation of human contact. Generations born with smartphones, for instance, tend to feel alone and isolated than older generations and lead to mental health issues in formative years.

Some people tend to think that the most important thing of the museums is to let everyone relax and enjoy, because it will let them overcome stress. One of the first things we need to take into consideration is that modern society have enough pressure in everyday life and information flow in erroneous, it all can even lead to depression, that’s why visiting cultural places like that may help to deal with it.

Chief among these is that university courses are characterized by a greater depth of knowledge and a faster pace of learning compared to school. This demands a higher level of critical thinking, independent research, and analytical skills, all of which freshmen may severely lack. Another contributing factor is the newfound independence that comes with university life. Unlike school, where there is often a structured timetable and close monitoring by teachers and parents, university students are expected to manage their own time, which can be a daunting task for those unaccustomed to this level of autonomy.

To address this issue, higher education institutions can adopt a range of strategies. One such approach is the implementation of comprehensive orientation programs designed to equip incoming students with essential study competencies, effective time management strategies, and awareness of available campus resources. Additionally, by creating smaller tutorial groups within larger classes, these institutes could provide students with a more conducive environment for asking questions and seeking clarification. Moreover, universities should promote a culture of open communication between professors and students, encouraging them to seek help when needed.

In conclusion, the transition from high schools to tertiary education poses a significant academic challenge for students due to the differences in terms of curricula and greater independence required. By initiating specialized orientation programs, cultivating smaller learning communities, and advocating open channels of communication, universities can help students overcome these challenges and thrive in their academic pursuits.","**Task Achievement: 7**

"In some countries, there has been an increase in the number of parents who educate their children themselves at home instead of sending them to school. Do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","It is still a subject of debate whether the homeschooling system for students is the right path for them as many people say that traditional schools have more suitable feasibility for pupils. In this essay, I disagree with the motion; in contrary, I believe that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits.

First and foremost, students may have more direct learning from the teacher, but it is undeniable that the homeschooling curriculum is not as structured as schools in general. This phenomenon in fact becomes a hindrance for the students and makes their knowledge inequivalent to each other. For example,  homeschooling children who move into a real institute to pursue their education may have more difficulty keeping up with the materials since they have different insights from their educators. As a result, this just lead a pressure for the learners and may push them to   burnout.

More than that, homeschoolers are likely to be out of touch with society since they do not have peer groups in their learning journey. Many parents might think this is a great choice to make their kids more safe and not experience bully, however, this actually lets the students lack  social relationships which is a crucial part of their personal growth. For instance, pupils from home learning systems tend to be loners or cannot make friends on a daily basis because they are not used to crowds. This issue is actually will affect their ability to survive in their adulthood later on.

To sum up, the advantages of learning at home for kids do not outweigh the disadvantages as it is in fact  this phenomenon has more disadvantages in  society. Not only learners will have less knowledge among the students, they will also hardly survive as human beings.","**Task Achievement:**

"In some countries, there has been an increase in the number of parents who educate their children themselves at home instead of sending them to school. Do you think the advantage of this outweigh the disadvantages?","In this present world, some family prefer to studied their children at home rather than school. In my opinion, I consider that being study in school will be more effectively. In the ensuing paragraph I will explain my view point in detail.

Firstly, the studying at school have more feature than at home. For example, when you do workshop with your friends, Effective communication skill is important that you should learn about. You can talk with many of your colleagues to be confident in yourselve. Moreover, it has been required at many place around the world, which is a good remarkable to get a jop. Furthermore, the teachers have more qualifications, hence, they can explain in detail deeply, which will translate information in the best way to students.

Secondly, the learning alone at home may lead your life to be miserable. For instance, In this time without accredited certification and a good knowledge, it is almost impossible to get a jop, which will not let you get chance to face hard life. In other words, you have to be highly educated to make your life easier. In addition, if parents does not qualified, they can not delivering knowledge to boy, therefore, worse knowledge get poor result, and this will be affect in his next future.

To conclude, the accredited certification is important for person, Which is not alow for people to get without educationl at university. It is clear that learn at institute is more beneficial than at home. therefore, more effectively.","**Task Achievement:**

"In some countries, there has been an increase in the number of parents who educate their children themselves at home instead of sending them to school. Do you think the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","There are more and more parents who would like to teach their children at home rather than letting them learning at schools in some states. I think these parents' views are unreasonable and its disadvantages outweigh the advantages, because firstly, schools have more professional learning resources than home and secondly, pupils obtain the unique group experiences at schools. 

The education departments and agencies control the largest amount of education resources than single family. Kindergardens, schools and collages own a lot of teaching materials, instructing aids, professional teachers and considerate libraries for students. Meanwhile, the governments invest a large number of money to each school in order to continue improving teaching and learning efficiency of them. Kids will be difficult to access these benefits if parents do not send them to schools. For example, in Shanghai, each primary school is funded by the local authority nearly one million pound to develop their teachers' group and teaching devices, which is impossible to be achieved in any pupil's home. 

In addition, students can acquire the experiences of collective lives. Some people might argue that teaching children at home which is one-to-one model. This will be more effective for learners to get a better grade in exam. However, examination is not the only goal of the education. Understanding how to cooperate with others and communication skills in the same age groups are also essential to each child. For instance, except for lessons, there are many activities and workshops organised in schools. Pupils could understand a lot of rules to cooperate with others and the communication strategies to make others feeling comfortable. These experiences can only be acquired at schools. 

In conclusion, I believe its disadvantages overweigh the benefits that teaching children at home rather than sending them to schools, because children cannot access many professional instructing resources and get collective experiences.","**Task Achievement:**

The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Numerous characters deem our conventional educating program will be altered, and students will not be attending class; in contrast, certain groups of people oppose and affirm pupils will be studying at school. Besides this, the old educational program will be lasting as usual. I reckon the current model will surely be changed by the 2050s.

Firstly, I view the revolution has already started. Thanks to cutting edge technology, now we have more options to continue lessons and business. For example, all college, universities, and companies stopped to work because of coronavirus, rendering people to live under quarantine, but still, my university's teachers have been lecturing their lessons using the internet and social channels including Facebook, Google Meet, and Zoom. Hence, this trend will definitely influence the traditional tutor and student interaction.

Secondly, this brand new teaching approach is more sustainable and effortless than any method which had been existed before. As arriving at school and coming back home takes a lot of time, and we usually do not attend class when we ill. However, we can take a course from schools by using a mobile phone or computer today, which is simple and has no obstacle. For instance, since I started acquiring knowledge from the internet curriculum; I realized that it took fewer hours than taking tutorials from the college. Thus, I prefer this new trend and presume its enhancement is inevitable.

Online education is a double edged sword, and there are various reasons for it. On the one hand, it is convenient, cost-effective and saves time. To illustrate, the individual does not have to commute to reach college or have a discussion with his/her tutor thereby saving time, and money, and plus the person can attend classes or lectures at the comfort of his/her home. Similarly, he/she can attend or review any missed lecture anytime.

Moreover, loss or any disruption in connectivity can hamper the entire process. Furthermore, the cost of these internet connections are not always affordable. Lastly, such online classes decline the gist of learning which as physical interaction which eventually leads to loneliness and depression.

"It is important for all towns and cities to have large public spaces such as parks and squares, Do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Today, people prefer to live in a town that caters to all the basic needs necessary to live a comfortable lifestyle. Some believe that a town must have some spacious public areas where different age group of people can spend their  time. I am in complete accordance with them for certain reasons which will be discussed further.

Cities with large public areas have their own advantages. Residents can socialize with their friends easily without any fear. For example, children can play at the park with their age group and get the opportunity to make a new buddies. This also helps in their growth as they learn to acclimatise to a new environments apart from their home. Secondly, senior citizens get an opportunity to meet like-minded people and sometimes get an opportunity to find gossip pals too. Such areas make them overcome the feeling of loneliness in their life. 

In addition to this, town centres of any city connects different age group at one place and caters to their shopping needs at one place. Youngsters get to hang out with their mates and do activities together. To exemplify, many new cafes, and play stations give you a personal space to spend quality time with your close ones. Not only that, the chances of getting cheated at such places get reduced as lots of people visit there regularly.

Others have their own reasons to not agreeing with my statement which cannot be ignored. They believe that space should be utilised to grow industrial areas which in return will increase the job opportunities for the citizens. It will increase the influx of money which can improve the standard of living of city dwellers. Moreover, with the increasing population, we need areas to develop more houses than parks. This need cannot be totally overlooked as well. 

In conclusion, every city should try to balance the needs of everybody living in it. Spacious public areas encourage a healthy lifestyle, socialisation and a safe atmosphere which is imperative in today's fast-paced routine. Substituting it with industrial or residential development will cause harm to people over a long period of time, therefore, I strongly back with the former viewpoint.","**Task Achievement:**

To commence with,  the first and the foremost merit is that it is beneficial for the health of people  because in morning time they can go for walking as well as in the evenings, also older people can spend their free time with their loved ones,and they can discuss about their daily happenings.  In addition, young people do lot of exercise in parks and gardens to keep their health fit and healthy,otherwise if there is no park they glue with electronic gadgets like mobile phones and computers and many more. 


Furthermore, little children get best place to play, they play with their friends in parks if any garden or square is not available for kids then they use roads and streets for playing it can lead to serious incidents.Moreover ,parks have some educational value too ,in schools ,students learn about environment protection in their studies and teachers can take their pupils to parks because students can see those pictures so lively which they see in their school books and they know about importance and protection of tress and flowers.

"Q. In some countries, celebrities complain about the way the media publicizes their private lives. Some people say that they should accept it as part of their fame. Do you agree or disagree?","It is inevitable for prominent people to have a lot of attention from the public. Therefore, some famous individuals make a complaint to the media in order to have their boundaries. Some people insist that they have to admit this phenomenon as part of their fame. However, I strongly disagree with this opinion. This is because famous people have a right to have private space in their lives and they might be victims of criminals.

To begin with, eminent people have a right to have their own space in their daily lives. In fact, everyone needs a private room where they can be protected from external factors including famous people. Having a boundary plays a pivotal role in people's lives. When people's rights are invaded by other elements, they might be able to have mental issues such as depression, anxiety, and so on. To cite an example, some celebrities in South Korea struggle with their mental problems since they do not have enough space for their schedule. They protest to media companies to stop posting their life in order to tackle this problem. Sometimes, they have medicines or conduct sessions to deal with their stress. Moreover, This situation might lead their fandoms to have a sense of worry and a lot of entertainment companies to lose their assets as prominent people in our society.

In addition, celebrities might be able to become victims of awful people. The number of criminals has been increasing nowadays, some people, called a stoker, cross the private rooms. They are more likely to invade eminent people's daily lives by following their schedules every single day and taking a majority of pictures. Sometimes, they even attack celebrities physically. For example, there was a serious crime in China. One prominent actress, named Wan Wei was captured by a stoker. The criminal said that he was able to check her life by watching media news all the time. This means that too much information about celebrities' lives might cause detrimental situations for them such as stoking, captures, and so on.

To sum up, it is evident that some people reckon that they deserve to monitor celebrities' lives because of their fame. However, I totally disagree with it, since famous people have a right to have their boundaries and might be targeted by criminals.","**Task Achievement:**

"In some countries, celebrities complain about way the media publicize their private lives. Some people say that they should accept it as part of their fame. 

Do you agree or disagree?","In some countries, famous individuals often feel unhappy about how  publishing interferes with their private lifestyle. Some argue that it is just part of being famous. However, I believe that celebrities, like anyone else, should be treated with respect and have the freedom to control what they share with the public. In this essay, I will share my thoughts on this topic and reach a final conclusion.

To begin with, some people believe that celebrities should accept media intrusion because they willingly choose to be in the spotlight. They share parts of their lives on social publishing, give interviews, and attend public events, which makes people interested in them. This sometimes blurs the line between their public and private life, leading the news to focus on personal matters. From this perspective, it is essential for personage to understand that fame has its ups and downs, and they should be prepared to handle both aspects.

Be that as it may, we should consider the human side of fame. superstars are just like regular people and deserve privacy and respect for their personal lives. The constant media attention can cause stress and emotional problems, and it can even harm their relationships and families. Being famous does not mean they should give up their right to privacy. Therefore,  publishing should focus more on their talents and achievements rather than invading their private matters without permission.

In conclusion, after discussing this topic in-depth, I agree that superstars have the right to complain about the news's intrusion into their private lives. While fame may be necessary for them to gain popularity, it should not give the media unrestricted access to their personal affairs. Finding a balance between public interest and respecting personal boundaries is crucial for maintaining a better relationship between public figures and the news.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes
delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative
development?","Education for universities always developing and changing for students to study easily without worrying about anything and nowadays they offer online classes for the one who cannot attend regularly because of difficult transportation or far distances. And I believe that this trend has so many benefits for everyone with current situations.

    Although online classrooms are already available in some universities since the covid-19 pandemics has happened, after that, almost every universities in the world have online courses now. By teaching from online, students does not need to care for physical contacts and focus only on studying and even they are sick or ill they no longer need to be restrained by fearing of infecting other people. Moreover, they will have more free time as there is no more transportation to get to the destination place because we can learn from the home with comfort. Also, students can now study from any universities from anywhere in the world despite their home countries.

    There are still left advantages for this phenomenon beside aforementioned ones. For example, because of the fees for online learning are always cheaper than learning on campus, people with tighter finance can now afford for their desire subjects. However, whether many of positive facts are existed, few drawbacks of this phenomenon also need to be considered. The most crucial thing is that there will be less practical practices for students compared to the campus and it is not possible for them to learn and practice in practical subjects from online. Lastly, there are still people who prefer more campus than online for the reasons which they think they feel unsatisfied and not effective learning from online.

Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"Under the development of sophisticated advanced technology, some higher education institutions can provide courses learned through the internet instead of traditional classrooms. In my point of view, this trend would create several benefits but there would be some drawbacks arising.
On the other hand, attending indirectly interactive courses is immeasurably beneficial to both professors and students. In other words, online courses bring so a wealth of convenience to learners since they enable students to save their quality time and finance as well. To be more specific, students can take part in any courses that they are interested in regardless of geographical distance or travel cost, which helps to reduce various burdens and enhance the gross enrollment rate significantly due to this flexibility. In contrast, a fixed curriculum in traditional classes makes students arrange their time and own schedule passively, which can limit their time management skills. In Vietnam, for instance, during the quarantine, online classes offered to students enable them to acquire knowledge sufficiently in safety without any time pressure or extravagant price of traveling.
On the other hand, there are also compelling reasons why this trend may bring some disadvantages. To start with, students may lose face to face interaction in unsociable learning hours, which can lead to non-comprehensive development in several immensely essential skills including interpersonal and communicative ones. Therefore, students are not able to be well-equipped in seeking jobs in the future which can affect career path negatively. Also, without competitiveness among peers, learners can easily lose the drive to try their best in order to have their desired academic results. An illustration of this is that, in some local high schools in my hometown, students usually have better performance at school compared to the online courses.
In conclusion, e-learning can bring so many pros to learners. Nevertheless, the downsides would emerge.","**Task Achievement:** 6.5

Some universities offer online courses as an alternative to classes delivered on campus. Do you think this is a positive or negative development?,"In parallel with the incredible development of technology, online curriculum has become one of the common features of university education, which is step by step replacing face-to-face classes. From my perspective, this movement brings about both positive and negative impacts to students.

On the one hand, offering online courses is considered to be very essential with students who always up to the ears with full-time learning schedule, especially those living far from the hall. In other words, online courses offer learners a flexible time to attend the lesson so that they can postpone the lessons to do their job or arrange it easily in their busy timetable without any worries about missing courses taught in the campus. This is extremely advantageous for students who have part-time job, which helps lighten their financial burden. Moreover, by purchasing online courses, students can have an access to the unlimited sources of accurate information which are provided by host academy. Thus, it is very beneficial for students who are seeking for crucial information for their essay, as well as those who slow on the uptake can replay the lesson as many times as they want.

On the other hand, online education still has some vital disadvantages which merely traditional classes can afford. Firstly, it is impossible for students to interact directly with their tutors and peers, which plays an integral part in their understanding the lessons. This is due to the large number of students studying online, it is time-lacking for both students and professors to communicate with each other. Secondly, the online learning solution requires lots of self-discipline to become effective, which just a small number of students can make it. For instance, first things may appear on the top are gaming badges, media, following are notifications from social network and pop-up advertises, which are real nuisances to the learning process.

In conclusion, having online tertiary education as an alternative choice is beneficial to some students. However, I think that the drawbacks are harmful in the long run and it should be taken into account.","**Task Achievement:** 7.5

"Today, people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In the contemporary era, the existence of advertising has crept into many aspects of daily life. From my perspective, this tendency has raised many disruptive concerns relating to the issues of manipulating public opinion and fostering overshopping.

To begin with, the popularity of advertisements can form a negative perspective on daily activities. It is true that the high density of advertisements leads to memorable footage stuck in the audience's minds. This might have the impact of changing their mindset in the long-term whether they are exposed to too many of these advertisements. For example, people watching car advertisements usually recognize that the background of these tends to be decorated in a luxurious way leading to a mindset that only the high-order classes can buy them. Because the target audiences of car sellers are often the high-income people, however, it could be seen that advertisements release in the public eye. Thus, it is understandable that many people hold a belief that owning a car is a represented aspect belonging to the rich community. Nevertheless, it is noticeable that this is a mistrustful idea and stereotype, and many forms of advertisements are manipulating the public to push their sales.

Furthermore, the high density has not only shifted people’s perspective  but also led to detrimental activities. Firstly, many advertisements promoting their items tend to constantly repeat not only on TV and smartphones  but also on billboards whether people going out, this would stick in customers’ memories and lead to a feeling of curiosity or fear of missing out. Therefore, trending products are usually hunted and attracted by a plethora of consumers. However, there are a variety of top trending products from several aspects of the market, leading to the customers’ tendency to splash all their money on them. It reckons that this is an expenditure habit and also harms the surrounding environment due to the high demands of producing too many items. Zara, a fashion brand, for example, is a well-known case of fast fashion. This company is usually boycotted because it would like to release a new collection for every new season and overproduct them. Therefore, the consumption is always lower than the production and the leftovers actually contribute to the global garbage dump more seriously.

In conclusion, it is true that many advertisements around daily lives have many highlighted negative impacts, including distorting the audiences’ views or breeding overconsumption.","## Task Achievement:

Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The advertising industry has undeniably thrived in recent decades, infiltrating many aspects of daily life including preferences. From my perspective, I consider this growth to be completely negative as it leads to a distorted perception of reality and overconsumption among consumers.

My foremost concern lies in the tendency of advertisements to cause audiences to falsely perceive the relative importance of major factors in their lives. They generally prioritise material possessions and physical appearance while failing to appreciate the value of other positive qualities. A prime example is advertising campaigns run by cosmetics brands which often praise physical attractiveness as being vital to a healthy relationship, although reliability and sympathy have been long proven by experts to be more influential in fostering personal connections. This well-established truth would likely be more popularly embraced if marketing messages did not exaggerate the significance of physical appearance.

The consumerism caused by excessive advertising is another reason for my disapproval of its popularity. Marketers nowadays are armed with new customer insights and advanced technical tools to skillfully entice viewers into making impulsive purchases. To illustrate, TikTok has developed a detection feature that can constantly identify the preferences and hobbies of users based on their content search, subsequently prompting suitable buying suggestions that accurately trigger their temptation to buy these things. This has given rise to impulsive buying that consequently leads to not only personal debt but also excessive waste which contaminates the environment since more unwanted obsolete items would be discarded. It is a testament as to why advertising campaigns are detrimental at both individual and societal levels.

In conclusion, the prevalence of advertisements appears to me as a disadvantage as they distort the audience’s view of life and breed overconsumption.

"In many countries, people decide to have children at a later age than in the past. Why? Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","These days, many couples opt for delayed childbirth. This trend can be attributed to career priorities. From my point of view, I consider that it has more drawbacks, especially the health of their offspring.

On the one hand, postponing parenthood can bring about significant advantages. Firstly, parents have financial stability after concentrating completely on their career. Therefore, children may receive a better education quality in a precious school. In addition, when pregnant at a later age, couples are more mature in emotional aspect, so their spouse relationship can become more stable. Furthermore, they would be ready to take care of their children. For instance, children who were born in families by elderly parents tend to be paid more attention than others since their parents have more family time.

On the other hand, embarking on parenthood at a later age can have unexpected disadvantages. First of all, that can increase the generation gap between parents and their offspring, leading to familial conflicts. In terms of the long run side, parents may not be around for as long as their children need them. Moreover, babies in such families are susceptible to mental diseases due to gene fault. As a case in point, according to health-related studies, infants who were born by mothers over 35 years old are prone to Down syndrome.

To sum up, opting for pregnancy at a later age can be because of heightened monetary burdens. That brings certain pros and cons about health and family aspects. From my perspective, the disadvantages should be given more concern than advantages.","**Task Achievement: 5.5**

"People nowadays tend to have children at older age 

Do the advantage outweigh the disadvantage","Nowadays, people tend to give birth at an older age. This might be due to emotionally preparation of the parents for the process, however, delay in the ability to conceive can also be disadvantage which I believe outweigh the disadvantages which can be medically corrected.

Firstly, many people nowadays believe that child birth and child care is not a small deal, that is why some people want to prepare either emotionally or financially towards having their children. For instance, I once had a neighbor who was a man at the age of 35 and still not married, so I asked him one day that what was his reason for that and he said he doesn’t want his wife or children lack anything whatsoever and that it’s after he made it by having a house and a car with steady income and most people importantly he wanted to be emotionally ready to have a child and get married till he do so, which I think it’s a good idea due to the fact that he wanted to be emotionally grounded before heading into it.

However, inability of the woman to conceive can be a great emotional stress and also causes depression on a long run, but this can be corrected in some ways. For example, I once had a patient who was not able to get pregnant for five years of marriage, many texts was done on both the wife and her husband which all came out good but was still not able to have a baby. Later on, the physician suggested surrogacy which came out well and they had a twin. So, this can be corrected medically.

In conclusion, although giving birth at an older age can be risky or due to some medical issues, I believe the advantage supersede the disadvantage because it reduces stress of coping with children and also to Cater for their children.

People nowadays tend to have children at older age. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"In the world today people tend  to give birth and start families at a later stage in their lives. From my own point of perspective, the merits outweigh the demerits because there might be unpalatable consequences resulting from this such as difficulty  in conceiving a child.

To begin with, Despite these disadvantages, there are certain benefits which can be encapsulated under the umbrella of stability, both: financial and familial. As a couple progresses in life they should have greater financial resources to draw upon to support their children and reduce the negative impact on poverty. In addition to the financial stability, there’s also stability in the family which should increase as the couple matures. As a result, children born at a later stage are less vulnerable to the negative consequences of divorce and family break up which are less common in older pairings.

Although the positive aspects appear to have great strength, there are also significant negative factors to consider. Foremost, as people age, they suffer from a greater amount of genetic degradation which can increase the chances of having a child with a genetic defect such as Down's syndrome. Another factor which can have a detrimental effect on a child’s quality of growth is the fact that older people tend to have less energy which means they are less able to cope with and raise their relatively more energetic young child. Moreso, there is also a generation gap in terms of relatability. As the age gap between the child and the parents increases their ability to relate to each other and share the same ideas about life could be placed under severe pressure. This may have negative consequences on the child’s upbringing and development. For instance, there could be numerous intra-family conflicts between youngsters and their elderly parents.

In conclusion, given the greater number of negative elements in comparison to the smaller number of positive aspects of giving birth at an older stage in life, it is reasonable to conclude that it is more beneficial to conceive and raise children at a relatively earlier age.","**Task Achievement:**

Undoubtedly, the pros of having children at a later age clearly outweigh its cons. This essay will discuss both pros and cons of this trend in the forthcoming paragraphs.

There are a few disadvantages of having little ones in the latter age. The predominant one is that at a later age, parents are not able to care for their children in an effective way as at that age they would not be physically well. They face numerous difficulties in order to care for their children. Moreover, if they are not physically good, they could not be able to give birth to children.

People nowadays tend to have children at older ages. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?,"Nowadays, people prefer to have children in their late thirties or early forties. There are certain advantages of having children at an older age. However, I feel there are far more disadvantages rather then advantages of having children at an older age.

Having a child late in life helps couple to strengthen their relationship. They can spend this time trying to know each other better and can also indulge in activities that they wish to do together, like exploring different places. They can also achieve more financial stability as they can plan out their finances and savings before child birth, helping them to have a secure future for themselves and their children.

However, delay in having children can also increase complications during pregnancy and there is also a possibility that the baby could be born with certain disability for example downs syndrome. Older parents would also require more physical strength that would be required to raise a baby. As babies tend to be more energetic, thereby indirectly tiring parents. Over a period of time, there can also be generation gap between the children and parents which could lead to arguments and disputes in the family.

In conclusion, having children at an older age has its own positives such as strengthening the bond between couples and providing a better financial security for the family but it still does not outweigh the negatives such as complications during pregnancy faced by the mother and the child, requiring more physical stamina and future disputes due to differences in opinions.","### Task Achievement:

People nowadays tend to have children at older age. Do the advantages outweigh of the disadvantages?,"These days, most married couples have a tendency to give birth to  offspring at an older phase of life. This trend can avail little more time for the parents to make necessary arrangements for the newborn. Also, it might result in incapability to reproduce. This essay will discuss both the gains and losses of giving birth at a later age.

Firstly, becoming parents at the elder stage has the privilege of having extra span to provide abundance to their coming child. In the current situation where there is a constant rise in the costs and education, it is very hard to think about having a kid. From 25 to 30 period of soul, the public struggles for their career and settlement with a good amount of earnings. For instance, a student who just passed out with his doctorate degree at the year of 29 and gets married at the youth of 31 has very little time to settle in his career and go for family planning. Thus, few parents are inclined towards having a juvenile after 35 life span of maturity and can give a better environment to the born minor.

Conversely, this could also cause health issues to reproduce after 32 years of lifetime. Growth after the thirties requires  taking care of the body as it becomes weak as compared to the below thirty years period. In this case, it could lead to weak reproduction strength in a person. To prove this, there are a lot of IVF and test tube baby centres available for such married couples. Therefore, it is advised by the senior citizens in  society to have a youngster soon after the wedding to avoid such fitness problems later.

In conclusion, babymaking at above 32 years of duration has both merits and demerits. However, giving birth to the baby at youth surely surpasses the possibility of abnormal well-being in reproduction.","**Task Achievement: 6**

Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?
Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Currently, it is quite common that people prefer to have babies later than it was in past. In this essay, I will explain the possible reasons of such a phenomenon and discuss pros and cons of it.

   To begin with, the possible reasons why some couples decided to have a child in their later age are the positive aspects that it has. Firstly, in many countries, both men and women have an opportunity to make a career and become a well-paid employee. In this case, some pairs think that if their work and salary are stable, they will probably be able to care for their children more properly. Secondly, there are those who want to be more mentally prepared for having a toddler. For example, my friend did not want to have children earlier than twenty five year because she was not understand what she should do then. Eventually, she got a child when she was twenty six and felt herself very confidently. 

   On the other hand, there are some disadvantages of this situation. One of them is the possible health issues. In other words, the later a woman has a baby, the more negative consequences may happen. For instance, my aunt became a mother when she was thirty five and it was difficult for her because of her age. Unfortunately, it led to the fact that doctors had to make an operation to save her and toddler's life. Besides, youth usually has more strength and energy than middle-aged people. Therefore, they are likely to manage with physical problems, while they care for their children.

   In conclusion, although having a child in later age has some positive sides, I think that its drawbacks outweigh benefits.","### Task Achievement:

"More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?
Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?","In the modern world, it is observed by some authorities and politicians that people have been preferring to be a parent later mid-ages when compared to the past. Economic reasons and career ambition have caused that the people postponed having a child. I believe that having a child in later age has more advantages not only individuals but also for society.
First of all, the human population has been increasing rapidly for a long time. Due to the locations’ high density, the living cost has increased suddenly. Moreover, the cost of having a baby is extremely high. So, most of the couples have decided to birth a child after they stabilize their economic power. On the other hand, especially after the idea of liberalism have been spreading all over the world since 1980, people have become more selfish and only focused on their career. For instance, if a woman has a baby at 30 years old, which is the most important age for her career, she has to pause her career for a minimum of 2 years.
High population in big cities mostly decreases the quality of the education system. If a society has a low number of students, the teachers are able to teach them more efficiently and productively. In other words, to have selected and quality people increase the production and profitability around the country. Moreover, to find a job is heavy for the citizens in the countries which have a huge population. If parents would choose to be parent later age, the population decreases, but at the same time, the unemployment rate will decline. On the other hand, the only disadvantage of this issue is a low workforce. But, after industry 4.0, there will be no need people to work in factories because of the robots and machinery powers would do more work than a human being.

"More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. 
Do advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?","Nowadays, most individuals chose to have kids in their later age compared to what it used to be in the past. In my opinion, I believe it is more beneficial to have kids at later age than at young age because it makes one fully prepared for child care and also reduces the rate of over population.

On the one hand, there are many advantages of late child birth. Firstly, it enables one to be fully ready for the responsibilities that come with having children. This means that when people delay giving birth till their later age, by then they would have been well established financially, morally and education wise. The reality is that people who give birth early are not yet ready for the consequent duty of care. This difference can be seen when comparing  children education between the American and the Nigerian. Early child birth has made many Nigerian unable to afford their kids' education, whereas, the American which mostly give birth at later age have highest level of children education. It can, therefore, be logically deduced that giving birth at later life prepares one for the task of caring for them. Secondly, giving birth at later age helps to control population rate. If people start having kids at young age, they tend to have many kids before menopause, hence delaying child birth will help individual family to give birth to fewer children.

Despite the numerous benefits of giving birth at later life, it however, has some few drawbacks. First of it is the reduced chances of conception. Scientists have shown that the best chance of conception is between the age of 18 years to 28 years and the chances keep decreasing with age. This means that people who decide to wait till later age risk not having kids at all. Furthermore, delaying child birth could also result in certain complications during labour and delivery. For instance, conditions like miscarriage, early onset of labour and other complications, are associated with pregnancy at later life.

In conclusion, although, birthing children at later age has its merits and downsides, on the balance, I however believe the benefits surpass any drawbacks it may have.","## Task Achievement:

The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Teamwork is crucial  everywhere as it ensures cooperation and effective learning. In the case of cooperation, it is more helpful and games accelerate it more. Before drawing a logical conclusion, I will explain why I strongly support this.

The main reason to support this statement is that offspring like to follow their peers and team sport confirms this. As a result, they can easily be trying to do similar things. My son, for instance, always follows his cousins of the same age and tries to do whatever they are doing.  Moreover, teachers should give the proper instruction and tailor their behaviour in the right direction. If teachers tailor their behaviour to a good one, they will get the best output. For example, if they are engaged in football or cricket where teamwork is important, they will be more cooperative as everybody wants to win.

 

On the other hand, group games help to improve leadership skills, which is important for everyone, especially in later life. As every team contains a captain, it helps to develop his captainship skills. Developing  guardianship skills for everyone, and rotating the leader in every game can help. Thus, every child is preparing themselves to become a leader. Furthermore, it also helps the other students to follow the instructions of the leader. Consequently, they are developing respect in their mind, which is important for the future. As a consequence, there will be less chance of conflict in the future.

To sum up, team sport helps the students for their next life. Therefore, I believe that if scholars follow this, we will get some future leaders, for whom we are struggling now.","## Task Achievement:

The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In today’s educational landscape, many people are thinking about the impact of team sports at school for the children. While various methods exist, I strongly believe that this solution is the best way to cooperate teenagers between them. In this essay, I will discuss why I hold this view and provide two supporting reasons.

To begin with, company game provides self-discipline which teaches younger how to work collaboratively. It is one of the main keys for success, fostering crucial interpersonal skills. For instance, in a volleyball team, players must know and understand how to communicate with each other to provide their strategy for achieving goals. Consequently, the collaborative experience not only teaches infants the significant role of working together, but also helps them develop strong bonds with their teammates.

Secondly, children are exposed to both success and failure together, which has an essential impact on collective responsibility. When a team succeeds, each member shares in the victory, reinforcing the idea that cooperation leads to mutual benefits. For example, in moments of failure, kids learn to support and uplift one another, understanding that overcoming challenges requires collective effort. As a result, this shared experience contributes significantly to character development and prepares them for future collaborative endeavors.

In conclusion, team sports at school stand out as the most effective method for teaching infants cooperation. The structured environment, coupled with exposure to success and failure as a team, imparts invaluable life skills. By engaging in team sports, teenagers learn to collaborate effectively and develop a sense of collective responsibility that will serve them well in their future endeavors.","### Task Achievement:

The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The assertion that team sports are the best method to teach youngsters how to cooperate is a viewpoint that has gained considerable attention. Although team sports can indeed foster collaboration skills, I believe that there are other effective avenues for teaching cooperation as well.

Essentially, team sports are very efficient when it comes to teaching young people how to cooperate with each other. Through a competitive environment, teenagers develop teamwork skills, self-esteem and strategising. For example, students can have many opportunities to recognise the strengths as well as the shortcomings of each teammate which can be used to better compete against their opponents, especially in sports with more than 5 participants such as football, volleyball and basketball. Additionally, playing sports also stimulates a working environment where people work towards a common goal together. Thus, pupils learn how to work together more effectively when they engage in these sporting activities.

On the other hand, it is important to recognize that cooperation skills can be cultivated through a range of activities beyond team sports. Firstly, cooperative learning strategies in classrooms, group projects, community service activities and even creative pursuits like theatre or music can also provide valuable opportunities for young adults to develop collaboration skills. In fact, these activities promote cooperation, and the ability to work effectively in a group setting. They encourage the youth to understand diverse perspectives, value teamwork and appreciate the benefit of collective effort. Secondly, not all offspring may be inclined toward or have the opportunity to participate in team sports. Thus, it is essential to provide a range of activities and environments that cater to diverse interests or abilities, ensuring that all youngsters have a chance to develop their cooperation skills.

In conclusion, while team sports offer valuable opportunities for teaching offspring to cooperate, I believe that cooperation skills can be developed through a variety of activities and environments. By providing a balanced approach that includes all activities, we can effectively nurture the value and skill of cooperation in adolescents.","**Task Achievement:** 7

The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"The problem of whether or not some countries should establish sports facilities for achieving a good range in the sports industry has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that creating a building specialised facilities is necessary for people, I claim that it would have a positive impact on the development of sports skills and keeping a healthy lifestyle for all dwellers. 

There are two main reasons why allocating money to sports construction is a useful decision for all countries. One of them is that sports facilities would be affordable for everyone. Sometimes people can't allow buying a subscription to a gym or activity circle. It would be a great contribution to maintaining an active lifestyle. Another cogent reason is advancing some talents among the young generation. This phenomenon could prepare sportsmen for different kinds of  international competitions. For instance, according to the statistics of the Worldwide Sports Community the countries which support and promote sports buildings for citizens have special respect on a national rank. 

I personally believe that establishing specialised equipment is relatively positive for several reasons with the main one being that it extends longevity. In addition, the promotion and propaganda of sports objects can lead to plummeting in smoking and an addicted population. 

To conclude, establishing and improving this kind of activity would lead to positive effects. Nevertheless, recognizing the importance of this irreplaceable part of social structure, it is advisable  to encourage the government to be more generous to their dwellers.","## Task Achievement

"The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school, to what extent do you agree or disagree?","People have different views about the best way to cultivate children's collaborative spirit. Although doing team sports is one of the efficient ways to achieve that, I believe teachers can find better solutions than this method.

On the one hand, team sports demand students to work closely and communicate frequently, which will improve children's cooperative skills. During this process, they will realize that everyone is born with strengths and shortcomings and only by working together can they have a competitive edge in the future. Also, doing team sports brings students more happiness than individual sports and help them to make new friends, which may motivate them to cooperate with others in the future.

On the other hand, other methods, such as working in groups to solve a practical problem, are also efficient to boost students' collaborative spirit. For example, there are a wide variety of interdisciplinary programs in many schools, which need the contribution of team members that are good at different subjects. Without joint effort, children will never be able to come to a satisfying solution. As a result, they will realize how important it is to cooperate with and learn from each other. Meanwhile, students working in these joint projects will also find it helpful to work together because it can enhance their problem-solving skills and boost their knowledge in all the subjects that are used.

The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school.

Because of the impact it has on the mind and body, playing a team sport is a good way to teach children life skills such as cooperation. 

As a child, it is difficult to sit in class and concentrate while having an excessive amount of energy. This is why allowing them to participate in a sport as part of their curriculum is crucial. The feeling of synergy when being with friends, in the outdoors and running around as much as possible is indescribable. They are using up all their energy without even thinking about it while exercising and becoming fit. By the time they are in class, they are ready to concentrate. This is one reason as to how sports allows children to cooperate in a school setting.  

Furthermore, there would be a set of rules that a team needs to abide by so that they are able to win. If the chosen sport is football, each position would have to communicate on when to pass the ball, work with each other as a team to identify the strengths but also follow the rules. If at any point the rules are not followed, a yellow or red card would be given. This shows that there are consequences if restrictions are not abided by. The children would be learning about teamwork, communication and cooperation while simultaneously having fun.

"The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school, to what extent do you agree or disagree?","It has been a topic of debate about how best to teach children teamwork, and the debate remains open to this day. Many people believe that team sports is the best way to achieve this goal. But, in my opinion, there are better solutions than this method.

Firstly, team sports at school can teach children important values such as teamwork and communication. By being in the communication circle with other pupils, they develop their social skills. Because not only one player or member of the team can win a game or competition. They should work together and understand each other for achieving the goal. Additionally, playing team sports brings students more happiness than individual sports and helps them make new friends, which can motivate them to collaborate with others in the future.

On the other hand, other methods such as working in groups to solve a practical problem are also effective in increasing students' cooperative spirit. For example, many schools have multiple interdisciplinary programs that require team members who are proficient in different subjects. Without joint efforts, children will never be able to reach a satisfactory solution. As a result, they will understand how important it is to collaborate and learn from each other. Meanwhile, students working in these collaborative projects will also find collaboration beneficial as it can improve their problem-solving skills and improve their knowledge of all subjects involved.

The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Team sports usually promote good values for the community. Some people say that children should learn to cooperate by practising this kind of sport at school. My opinion, I strongly agree that teaching cooperation through team sports would be the best way for pupils to incorporate this attitude into their lives. 

Nowadays, soccer, rugby, hockey and volleyball are incredibly famous around the globe and kids know them very well as they watch them on the TV and even practise them in sports centres but also at school. In particular, physical education teachers always try to introduce the students to the beautiful world of  cooperative activities by explaining the rules of each sport and then letting them practise in the field. For example, in  practice, they need to organise into two teams and play soccer when they have to pass the ball to score, they need to trust and know each other in order to improvise with the ball. It is a fact that children adore playing and doing exercise, so why not use it to help them to improve their collaborative skills?

In addition to this, teachers can motivate children to compete in regional tournaments where they need to strengthen their relationships to create a strong group and to improve human values like cooperation and respect. For instance, in the school where I used to work, every year was a great competition in which all the students from all levels used to participate. Teamwork through different activities and sports was implemented, and even the families were involved in organising meals and supporting their children. There is no doubt that the kids were highly motivated and really enjoyed the tournament.

In conclusion, teaching sports at school, where pupils can learn how to organise themselves in the field like a team and get motivated to participate in scholar competitions would contribute to making a huge change in their attitude and the manner in which they interact with each other. Sports may not be the only way to teach this, but it is by far the most practical way to teach the young to act cooperatively in their community.","**Task Achievement:**

Participating in games with a team will help to improve the cooperate skills in the children. I completely agree with this statement. In this essay i will explain with the reasons and examples.

To begin with, first reason behind it is that, apart from the team sports not only assist cooperation but also learn socialization. In other words, in this modern era , younger generation do not have time to mingle with others and share their problems. as a result, the communication skills are reduced. and morover, team games assist how to cooperate eachother when the problem occurs.

The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is a variety of sports which are played and introduced to the world. Day by day, people intend to create different types of sports and they can be categorized into two sections  single and team. Although, the majority of the games fall into a single type, team games can be shown  discipline of a person to achieve something bigger in larger groups. I strongly agree, children should be taught the value of team sports as a foundation of school education.

In the modern world, humans have been the classic example for all causes and threads.  It all depends on the human attitude towards the world well being. In this case, team sports give the best attitude. ,Moreover team sports cannot be played as selfish. You have to give priority to the entire team's idea and create plans to win a game. 

Also, one more important thing is to learn how important everyone has to play their part to win a game and be supportive of each other when someone within the team keeps failing. Furthermore, winning or losing in a game is expected, we should not blame each other, rather we must be thinking about improving as a team for the next game. This kind of role plays in childhood days, gives a big exposure to grow as a person who will understand another person and to respect ideas. 

To conclude , modern world people are trying to come up by pushing another person down without thinking about it twice. I believe team sports can make a person  think in a broad way and be united with each other despite all the facts.","**Task Achievement: 6.0**

"The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school, to what extent do  you agree or disagree?","In recent years, teamwork plays a vital role in schools and organisations. Researchers argue the  fact that students should learn about collaboration by playing games in schools. I partially agree  with the statement, and I will provide the substantiated arguments in the upcoming  paragraphs.  To commence, physical activities done in group brings team spirit. To put it another way,  teachers should encourage the pupils in making teams to do sports activities as it builds the  confidence of students. Moreover, playing together would reduce conflicts and helps in  spreading love and harmony in the society. As an illustration, games such as football and  hockey are often played in groups. Such games help in bringing peace in society. In fact, games  unite the different religions and brings happiness in the communities. Furthermore, strength  and endurance help in uplifting the group.  On the contrary, schools should make academic groups and perform other cultural activities to  bring collaboration in the society. In other words, teachers should give team assignments such  as group presentations to encourage pupils in cooperating. Indeed, such activities would be  helpful for children who lacks interest in sports activities. Also, such projects would foster the  learning process using practical knowledge. In addition, schools should organize cultural  programs. For instance, group dance, bhangra and would encourage the students to work in  groups.

Some people argue that governments should make laws regarding people's nutrition and food choices to improve public health while others contend that this is the freedom of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Now a days people are demanding strict legal provisions on essential nutrition and food behavior to improve people’s health.  However, the others advocate that taking vitamins and food is completely individual choice. In this essay, I will discuss on both perspectives and will put my own viewpoint at the end of the essay.

On the one hand, some group of people strongly believes that the government should be responsible for formulating laws on public health. This is because people are paying taxes to the government from their regular income. For example, the government collects its revenue from the taxes of its citizens so the government has to act on voicing for people’s health. Thus, some set of individuals emphasize on the responsibility of health ministry on advancing legal laws on public health.

On the other hand, some second on the sole responsibility of government in developing laws for health of its native. They state that the wellbeing is completely a personal choice and dependent on individual’s right to be fit and healthy. For instance, some trusts that the different food habits and supplements work differently on each individual’s body. Furthermore, same provisions on health laws may not create the same benefit to all individual because each individual has different body type and have need different preferences on food. 

In conclusion, some agrees that government should be made accountable for legalizing health laws whereas some disagrees and believes that health is an individual preference.

"Some people think that public health within a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food. Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. 


Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Globalisation and Industrialization has impacted working and eating habits of almost everyone residing in Tier 1 or Tier 2 cities. Fast food chains and QSR restaurants have emerged as a go-to place for people in corporate jobs due to high workload. Public health in general, depends majorly on these two factors. This essay will discuss both aspects of government intervention in regulating availability of different eating options in order to improve general health in the country. 

 Although eating habits are unique in every region, religion and even generation, there is one similarity, which is need of nutrition for our body to maintain immune system and ability to perform the required tasks. Depending of various job types, different diet patterns are more appropriate for different people, and accordingly humans have developed their eating habits around it. This directly affects the health which, albeit gradually, improves overtime if we consume nutritious food; and remain physically active throughout the day.

I strongly advocate that maintaining overall health should be the responsibility of oneself in general. However, authorities should ensure that private companies are not overburdening their employees to perform more than what their job entails. Regulating nutritious food entirely may result in favouritism and undue inclination towards one industry, hampering the level playing field for various businesses.

"Some people think that public health within a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food. Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Many people believe that the level of health and hygiene can improve only by the government`s monitoring such as imposing some policies related to food supply; however, others are in this opinion that personal decision and responsibility have played a vital role in this subject. In my perspective, both the government`s legislation and personal care, are necessary.

On the one hand, one of the important causes of health problems is the food which people consume. If governments legislate various laws related to this issue the level of problems, which people face during their life, will increase, and life expectancy will be extended. Moreover, by improving the agricultural techniques, the mortality reduction emerges that is because better nutrition will be shared among people. To illustrate, If urban centres start to deliver clean water and remove waste, the dramatic reduction in water and nutrition will be occurring, general personal hygiene grows. So, governments can be a crucial aid for declining in mortality rate and rising in health level.

On the other hand, people were given advice about what are the causes of disease and how they can prevent infectious disease by caring about personal health, so what they need is to pay attention on little easy subjects such as watching their hand, do not use others brush, and visiting a doctor in every specific period to check up. Furthermore, sports have been one of the necessary fields that decrease the risk of being sick, so provided that one has a regular daily exercise, they will not face difficulty especially when they become old. Thus, without personal-care, public health will not develop.

To conclude, it is obvious that states are vital aspects to promote health-related items as well as self-attention. In my notion, both self-care and the state-care about the aspects which affect health are equally important, and these hygiene improvements can be more effective if both groups cooperate.","**Task Achievement: 7**

"Some people think that public health of a country can be improved if the government make laws regarding nutritious food but others think that it is the matter of personal choice and personal responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.
","Nowadays, healthcare condition is becoming more and more essential to each individual. Some people argue that the government should take measures to improve health of their citizens by imposing food laws. Others believe that everyone has responsible for their own health. This essay will discuss both points of view before coming to a reasoned conclusion.

On the one hand, in fact governments play a critical role to ensure well-being of their citizens. First of all, governments are responsible for the quality and safety of food in the market, they could introduce strict laws to make sure that public heath will not be damaged by polluted or expired food. Moreover, using unauthorized chemicals, selling unhygienic and low-quality food should be forbidden by the government. For example, eating fast food may lead to severe diseases such as increase in blood cholesterol, raise blood pressure and obesity. In some countries, the government imposes a high tax on junk food with the objective of discouraging its consumption. All of these are measures that can have a positive impact on public health.

On the other hand, in my opinion healthy lifestyle is a choice and habit of an individual, each person should hold accountable for their health, and the government cannot monitor the lifestyle of every citizen.  For instance, if people follow a sedentary lifestyle such as eating junk food, being a potato couch, being ignorant to break their bad habit and so on, they will surely suffer from physical health issues. However, the government cannot do much to help these people. Furthermore, the choices of individuals greatly affect the overall health condition of a nation. Thus, each person should choose more suitable food according to their own physical conditions, and retain a kind of good eating habit for long term so as to have a healthier lifestyle.

In shorts, there are several reasons for health problem, and I strongly believe that both governments and individuals should join hands to improve the situation.

"Some people believe that the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers instead of benefitting them individually.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is belief that says ""The main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers instead of benefitting them individually"". I mostly agree to this statement. A school teachs not only an academic lesson but also a social lesson to correct students' conduct. Moreover almost all school have similar lessons, so students will grow up to be same good adults. But maybe there are some places that are not similar to others.

First of all, In every school, they teach general academic subjects such as Math, Science, English and etc. In addition to these subjects, there are lessons intented to make the students become responsible citizens of the society. For example, social studies or law studies that teach students what they should and should not do. And that they will recieve punishment if they do something wrong. Also, when students spending their time in schools, they will learn how to behave and interact with each other. School disciplinary is also the way to guide children to the good path.

Furthermore, because every school have the same standard for the graduated students. Their curriculums tend to be the same. And that has a negative effect on the student. Because everyone has his own talent. Teaching students the same thing doesn't mean that thay will get equal score. To illustrate, when someone who's good at drawing and someone who's good at Math study Algebra together, he who excels at Math will do better. But, does this mean that students who get bad grades are bad student? No, they may be bad at Math but they have something they good at too. Unfortunately that their capabilities have to be measured with an only same standard.

However, some schools may not be like the others. There are a few schools whose intent are not just to bring up their student to be good people but encourage them to be the best version of themself. These schools still have the same requirement for their students to meet. but they support things that are not in the requirement too. To give examples, some schools permit students to join clubs of their interests after studying periods, such as, art club, music club and sports club. Furthermore, these schools curriculum may not limit to just science course and social studies course. They have other course like literature, management and art course too.

To sum it up, every school have similar ways of teaching and preparing their students to become good citizens and workers of the societies. Yet, they teach the same things to every students , despite the fact that everyone is unique and has his own way of learning. Therefore, you could say that this way of teaching doesn't benefit their students individually. That's why i agree with this statement. However, there might be some schools that do it differently. While keeping the standards like other schools, they support their students individually too. For their intentions that students will grow up not only to be good citizens, but also to be themself that they dream of.","### Task Achievement (4.5)

23.Some people think the main purpose of schools is to turn the children into good citizens and workers rather than to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Write an essay with no less than 250 words.,"Determining the goal of schools is always an interested issue. Numerous people assume that the main purpose of schools is to turn the children into good citizens and workers. However, in my opinion, the major target of studying in schools is to benefit learners as individuals. This essay will discuss both of these aspects.

On the one hand, set of people believe that study in schools can help people accelerate their knowledge and relevant skills such as teamwork, social relationship, or decision-making. Hence, these sources are strongly supporting to their career. In addition, theories in the classes are fundamental lectures which often include basic principles or regulations. Accordingly, by observing these information, a person can gain the good citizen certificate. Consequently, people can easily become good residents or excellent workers.

On the other hand, and in my point of view, a good residents or excellent workers is only the grounds to benefit a person as individual because a person can only receive the benefits when they can understand them. For example, learning in school can help people proactive their finance plan. Therefore, they can decide what they want to do or to obtain. Thus, regulations are only support tools in the development progress of the society. Consequently, each person is knowing what decisions made them better.

In conclusion, turning the children into good citizens and workers are only a number of benefits of learning in schools. The main purpose of schools is to benefit students as individuals.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think that the main purpose of school is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some communities argue that the main objective of the school is to turn juveniles into good inhabitants and workers, rather than to advantage them as individuals. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement, and I will elaborate on it in this essay. 

On the one hand, in today's world, the majority of young people attend school and dedicate a significant portion of their time to it. As a result, they can learn about acting politely, which leads to kind and respectful folks. Moreover, when they play with various friends, they can learn social skills so they will be good workers. For example, some studies show that if children do not go to school and stay at home, young nations will turn into criminal people. In addition, most criminal communities have no mates so they do not know how to communicate with each other. Therefore, in schools, study is not the only thing to learn there are a lot of crucial things to learn from that place.

On the other hand, academies do not exist to make good people and gangs. Furthermore, they should teach and help find juvenile talents. For instance, nowadays, our society has various jobs and we do not know which one suits us and which one wants to do. However, In South Korea, numerous educational institutions only teach main subjects such as Korean, English and mathematics consequently, many pupils cannot find their abilities so they lose way about their future. For this reason, academies ought to assist in finding student's talents, and it will benefit our communities.

In conclusion, I partially agree with this statement. Schools must teach their pupils to turn into good citizens and workers and also help them find abilities because it is essential. So, we must teach them to balance, and that will be good not only for the young public but also for our societies.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people think the main purpose of schools is to turn the children into good citizens and workers rather than to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree,"In contemporary society, the primary purpose of schooling has been under heated debate. Many people hold the view that transforming students into good citizens and workers is the fundamental goal of education rather than concentrating on individual betterment. From my perspective, I agree with the given sentiment and this course of the essay will elaborate carefully to provide the reasons for my personal opinion.

First and foremost, it is likely universal that a good individual should be useful to certain communities. It means that a well-skilled person might not be defined as a good one if those harms or are unsupportive to society. Therefore, schools in which children's perspectives could be changed officially and openly should mainly focus on educating moral lessons and qualifies alongside particular subjects or skills. Being community-minded, for example, seem to be a necessary characteristic which is needed to be taught by school education, especially in fast-paced life in which there is likely sympathy insufficient. In a nutshell, a community could not be prosperous unless every single citizen is dedicated to bigger purposes.

However, it is indicated that generally moral lessons are unlikely the only target of schooling since the development of societies relies significantly on single and personal innovations. specifically, Throughout the countless year of humankind's life, there was numerous innovative inventions and explorations that were undertaken by genius brains that have been changing human life totally and positively such as America's exploration and invention of the internet and computers, or chronic disease treatments. Therefore, alongside the primary goal, seeking and nurturing individual talents should be taken into consideration in order to create a quality workforce for our community.  Seeking talent shows, for example, specific courses, and modern facilities should be provided free for children when they are still in school seats.

In conclusion, in spite of individualism development in contemporary society schools should play the main role in educating the young generation to turn out useful and well-educated people in their community. Besides, increasing personal betterment is not likely less crucial, however, it does not seem the major purpose of education.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people believe that the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers instead of benefitting them individually.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Studying is one of the most crucial parts of people's lives. If a question about the main objective of the school is addressed, it will be challenging for us to make a decision. Some people are firm believers in changing pupils to good citizens. Others, however, had shown devotion to not necessary. This essay agrees that schools have to turn students into good workers because they can learn to follow rules and social skills.

The first and most obvious one is that students spend more time at school than at home. As a result, pupils can learn how to respect other people both in the same ages and older people such as teachers. Moreover, in school, teachers can obligate the student to follow the rule, for example, to be on time and be honest in tests. Consequently, kids will know the fundamental rules in the school and will learn the punishments if they do not follow these. Therefore, they can learn how to be a good citizen in the future.

Furthermore, another reason is that students can learn social skills. According to the research in a local university in Bangkok, it indicates that kids who lack  friends will become introverted and might have mental problems leading to a crime. In contrast, School is the place that many kids staying together to learn how to survive in  society using  social skills such as communication and negotiation. So they can learn how to work as  teamwork.

In conclusion, there are several objectives for the school however the most important one is teaching junior to be  good people in the forthcoming. In my perspective, as children are the foundation of the future so we have to attend to the younger generation and hope that they will become good citizens in the future.","### Task Achievement: [7.5]

TO START WITH A NUMBER OF PEOPLE STUDY EXTENSIVELY IN OTHER TO BE RECRUITED INTO THE MILITARY TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT FIGHT COMBATS, THEREBY IMPEDING THEIR UNIQUE DEVELOPMENT THAT COMES WITH FAMILY BONDS AND SELF DISCOVERY.

Young people who commit crimes should be treated in the same way as adults who commit crimes. To what extend do you agree or disagree?t,"In this modern era, youngsters who commit offences should be punished in the similar ways like mature people. I do think that younger criminals should be behaved less strictly than older offenders. In this eassy, i will discuss the viewpoint and give relevent ideas about the issue.

To begin with, young adults are less matured compared to adults this is why they should not be considered in same punishedments.Furthermore, sometimes they are more susceptible to being afflicted by bad peers or role models.To make an exmaple, many of them may join the aggressive gangs,in which they commit a sort of illegal works like; smoking, teasting, hijacking and so on. Therefore, the youth should not be punished the same as the grown man who committing the types of offensive words.

Besides, less proper guidance and violations from one's parents can be the main reasons for youngstars becoming criminals.In addition , nowadays parents are often busy with work so that they may be involved with some unwanted crimes like stealing something pen,pencil,sharpner and many more.To explain , punishments must be more flexible for children having such backgrounds. Thus, in this way, it is significant to consider their circumstance and why they inevitably commit crimes.

In conclusion, if youngstars commit crimes, their lack of responsibility and surroundings should be considered when they are handled by authorities, in order to rehabilitate them effectively. I do believe that age should be considered while punishing because it will help in reducing crime in the society in future.","## Task Achievement:

In many countries, People have problems  finding jobs after their graduation. In this essay, we will discuss the reasons behind this problem, and what are the best solutions to ease it.

Our society finds unemployment a serious issue and plays a major impact on individuals and the community. with regard to the impact on the individual, A person can not generate money without a job, So jobless people will burden their own families because they have to work harder to cover the expenses of their children, instead of enjoying their old age.

Also, unemployment has a negative influence on  society by making people stressed, and frustrated, and as a result of this, People might do illegal things such as becoming drug addicts and joining gangs.

The fact that students cannot find jobs after graduation is the cause of certain complications and can be addressed/solved/tackled/resolved using several methods .

To begin with, there are a huge number of issues related to young jobless people on a personal as well as community level. Firstly, in terms of finance, young people cannot generate income unless they have a career. Becoming financially dependent, they can face a lot of difficulties in maintaining their daily life. Also, they may become a burden to their own family, especially their parents who have to work harder and harder to cover their expenses instead of enjoying old age. Moreover, workless people are one of the reasons that make social evils more serious. A person without a job usually spends most of the time doing nothing, which makes it easy for them to engage in wrongdoing such as robbery, theft, and drug addiction. 

To minimize and partially solve this problem,  education for the younger generations as well as government action are the most important. First of all, schools should equip students with practical skills and organize career orientation sessions for students. By doing this, it can be easier for them to find jobs after graduation. Also, motivating and encouraging students to participate in vocational training after leaving school for both studying and earning an income can help ease the problem. Furthermore, the government should promote the operation of local career and job placement centres. The activities of these centres should be propagated so that young people can easily access more job information.

This problem would cause the lack of workforces to fulfil certain position in the societies.

Most of the youngsters feel that they choose their major incorrectly. Due to lack of infomation, either the program prospect in the future or study field unfitted to their favour.

There are two remedies might be able to utilize to tackle these problems. The fresh graduate students, perhaps, should take special qualification courses or trainings in order to gain their skill which are needed to get an occupation. Some company might offer several jobs which simply meet with certain qualification. This would assist the youth unemployment to obtain jobs. Providing the pre-graduate student with an intensive counceling is equally crucial.

Some believe that people are naturally born leaders while others feel that leadership skills can develop. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"There is a tremendously controversial prospective heating up a debate the origin of the leadership. While some people hold a strong view that it is a natural skill, the opposites make a statement that a person can become a leader through the experience as well as the knowledge. This essay will discuss both point of view and my personal opinion about this phenomenon

Evidently, a wealth of people are naturally born leaders since they own the strong characteristics to become a leader such as being outgoing person, gregarious and full of energy. All these personality traits help the leader to manage, to gather people together and to inspire and motivate them. Vladimir Putin, a president of Russia can be cited as an outstanding example that he natural born political leader who inspires many people with his boundless professional abilities, charisma and display astounding skills. Hence, being sociable, charisma and having strong traits are important natural skills for being a chief.

Although the leadership skill is one of natural skills, I still belive that it can be built and enhanced.  There are a bunch of elements that make someone a great leader, such as discipline and resourcefulness, which can definitely be developed through one's upbringing and life period. For instance, to become a pioneer as well as a president of Vietnam, Hochiminh had to spent three decades in this life on travelling around the world and  acquire the knowledge from developed nations in this time to find an ideal way to lead our country. Therefore, beside a natural skill, leadership can be developed by the experience in life. 

In conclusion, although a strong leader's talents and traits are both genetic and can be improved by training, observation, and a lot of hard work, there are many people born without natural leadership skills who can still become good leaders thank to their attemption.","## Task Achievement: [Band Score: 6.5]

Some believe that people are naturally born as leaders while others feel that leadership skills can develop. Discuss both views and give your opinion,"It can be observed that the issue of leadership has grown in importance over the last decades. This fact has brought to our lives the debatable aspect whether leaders have an intrinsic power to carry it out or, on the contrary it is other skills which can be developed. I will discuss both sides and I will express my opinion in the following essay.
As far as leaders are concerned, it goes without saying that their attitude can promote the idea of having born with this characteristic in a very successful way. Additionally, many people do believe that there is an awful lot of children who demonstrate these traits from the kindergarten. Hence, albeit they have never learnt these manners, they will grow older accordingly, and this plays an extremely important role. Therefore, not only are there people who have shown the mentioned features from the childhood, but also there is a complex myriad of relationship between management and personality. They are strongly interwoven, and would be really difficult to distinguish them.
On the other hand, it seems to be clear that had it not been for experience and exposure, many people would not have achieved to develop certain traits. In this case, it is highly remarkable that a staggering amount of people have boosted their authority abilities satisfactorily through training. For instance, by reading or even practising, we are quite likely to learn how doing it. It is, thus, when it comes to leadership, strongly indispensable to take into account the strong power of the discipline and diligence.
In the light of above exposed, I am inclined to believe that despite the fact many people could have borne with these characteristics, it is perfectly understandable that we could learn how we do it if we persevere in it.","**Task Achievement:**

"Every day, millions of tons of food are wasted all over the world. Why do you think this is happening? And how can we solve this problem?","Nowadays, to serve a billion people each day we need a huge of food and sometimes people can consume it. In the following essay, I discuss some of reason why people do it and how to solve that problem. 

There are a hundred of reasons why a large amount of food is wasted every year. First, since most fresh foods, such as meat and vegetables, are perishable, they usually have expired or best before dates. This means that if people do not consume them quickly enough, 

foods will be expired and no longer to use, which results in food waste.

Second, the way humans prepare foods also contributes to food waste. 

For example, if foods are badly prepared, either at home or in the restaurant, people will confuse to eat and food waste will often occur as a result. 

Nevertheless, there are also a variety of solutions to improve this trend. 

First, even if some foods are not use for humans, they can be composted or used to feed livestock or animals. This would not only benefit the agriculture industry but also help reduce land filled organic matter that can be damaging to the environment. 

Second, even if the food waste is not use for livestock, it can still be used as a material to produce renewable energy. For example, in Singapore and some develop nations have taken steps to turn organic matter from food waste into biogas, generating electrical power at very low costs. 

In conclusion, even though food waste seems not harmless in today’s world, there are various ways to recycle it. Feeding livestock and generate energy can be two of the most useful ways to tackle food waste.","### Task Achievement:

"Every day, millions of tons of food are wasted all over the world. Why do you think this is happening? And how can we solve this problem?","There has been an ever-increasing trend that people discard an excessive amount of food waste from all corners of the world. Although this problem can be attributed to a great number of reasons, some feasible solutions can be considered to address this.

There are a number of reasons for this adverse tendency. The first reason for the rise in the amount of food waste is the increased supply of cheap and readily available food, which encourages people to buy more than they really need. For example, in order to increase sale revenue as well as compete with other brands, many fast-food restaurants nowadays have launched plenty of promotion programs such as “By 2 get 1 free”, which has attracted hundreds of customers and thus the huge amount of food waste will end up in landfills. Another reason is that in order to deal with busy lifestyles, people tend to buy food for the whole week rather than go to the supermarket on a daily basis. However, some kinds of fruits and vegetables easily become rotten within a few days and then thrown away.

A wide range of strong measures must be implemented, not only by the government but also by individuals, to combat food waste. This first solution is that the government can develop some action plans to raise consumers’ awareness of food appreciation. This could be done by getting people involved in global food campaigns such as Think.Eat.Save and anti-food waste campaign, helping their citizens to become more conscious consumers and when everyone is fully aware of this, they would think more carefully when it comes to shopping for food. In terms of each consumer, it is important to make a detailed shopping list before going to the supermarket. This way helps them to have time to prepare and decide wisely what products should be bought, which eventually saves a lot of unnecessary food.

"Some people think the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel.

To what extend do you agree or disagree

?","Global environmental changes are unquestionably the most prevalent and worrying issues in any society, and their prevention should be taken seriously. Despite a few problems, such as plastic production and the absence of recycling, I reckon that the decision of the raising prices for fuel is definitely the best way to prevent the worldwide catastrophe.

On one hand, the main environmental issue of global warming is caused by two significant factors, which are burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Firstly, expensive fuel could actually decrease a number of cars bought by people due to the fact of economic purposes. As a consequence, people would have a lower level of horrible emissions, which are produced by cars. Secondly, if the amount of vehicles is stable, hundreds of new roads would not be needed, and more forests and parks could be saved. Therefore, the greenhouse effect, caused by transport pollution, could be managed by the natural process of carbon dioxide absorption.

On the other hand, there are still a few factors, which could not be removed by changing a price tag. It is known that plastic has not been already replaced by other materials, so its production could not be immediately restricted. Moreover, most people are not used to recycling various types of waste, consequently, tons of rubbish are supposed to threaten the surrounding area. Therefore, hundreds of humans consider fuel price raising to be an inappropriate solution.

To conclude, despite varying opinions, I believe that the advantages of increasing the cost of fuel completely outweigh the relative disadvantages. Without a doubt, this solution would be the first useful step, which government should take in order to protect the environment.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think the best way to solve global environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Environmental problems like pollution in this world is taking new upper limit and getting worsen day by day. Some individuals believe that the most effective way to deal with worldwide ecological difficulties is to raise the price of fuel. However, I am of the opinion that it will benefit the society to some extent only, which will be discussed in the following paragraphs.
Increase in price of fuel will limit the personal transport of an individual to some levels and commuters will find other alternatives to travel on daily basic such as public transport or electric vehicles. Majorly the middle class families will be effected with this step and persuade them to follow local city transport in the sake of controlling pollution. Recently, in Delhi, the government took initiatives to control the personal vehicle on road by charging double amount on petrol purchase for own carriers, thus the output was quite effective and number of vehicles drop down approximately 80 percent from the service roads. 
However, on the other hand, the major contributors of air pollution are the airplanes. In that case lowering the price will not impact much as air travelling is carried by mostly rich people and it is part of luxury. People who prefer travelling by air as compare to road are always keeping the time limit as priority instead of money. Hence, increasing price will not lower the usage of air transport. Thus, we need to look for an alternative solution to minimize the pollution hazard. 
In conclusion, increasing price of fuel will profit the community in terms of limiting usage of personal conveyance, but for some who choose time as the limit instead of money will not be effected with this idea. Consequently, I believe inflation in price will not resolve the ecological problems.

Films and computers games containing violence are popular. Some people say they have negative effect on society and should be banned. Others say they are just harmless relaxation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"In this century many teenagers like playing video or online games that contain violence, parents and people believe that it can have a bad effect and make them angry, and some say that films also make them  less patient and be less nicer I will discuss further in this essay about this topic.

First, right now more than half of the them have violence and killing so society thinks that it can affect young children, but not only do these have an age rate but they also decrease stress. Video games help many people with their anxiety and stress relief for example in workplaces where society has  room to rest and play, they will be more influenced because sometimes they forget how strong they are. Movies also can have a bad and a good effect it only depends on how the public sees the movie if you see it with a bad mindset even the nicest film in the world will have a bad impression on you.

Secondly, in many cases they really have a bad influence on children and teenagers and make them angrier, it happens when they are not ready to understand that  life in society is different from playing a game and they believe that they are mixed not separate, therefor they become harmful for the public around them. I think that it depends on the parents which is good for your child to play it or not.

To conclude, video games may have a bad effect on young adults but we should consider other options that can be a push for doing harmful activities like  the environments they are living in or the public they communicate with, but this subject needs more investigation in the future.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that illegal Internet downloads are having a negative effect on the music industry. Others feel that they have little or no impact on artists. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"The music industry has changed vastly since the golden days of Beethoven and Mozart. With the rapid growth of the internet and smartphones, listening to music has become easier than ever. Instead of having to attend concerts, listeners can just plug their headphones into a smartphone and listen to music online. While this has its fair share of benefits, record labels have been hesitant to expand into the online music industry since it has various drawbacks, including piracy issues and monetization. In this essay, I will discuss the aforementioned issues as well as giving my own opinion.

On one hand, the explosive growth of online music websites has made it exponentially harder for record labels and artists to control and monetize their work. These people are concerned that as the internet music industry grows, so do the piracy issues. This may cause everyone to copy each other, making music seem unoriginal and uninterested. It can also discourage artists to produce and release music, as there are no ways for them to ensure that their music is being used as they intended as well as controlling where their works are being published. Overall, illegal Internet downloads can have negative effects on the artists and the music industry as a whole.

On the other hand, having the ability to publish music on the internet - where millions of users are actively using and discussing every day - has helped new artists get discovered and grow. Moreover, the growth of music piracy has pushed streaming platforms to take extra steps to prevent illegal downloads. It's not hard to understand why in the early 2000s, record labels and artists were trying to take down music streaming platforms that were allowing users to download music freely and distribute it wherever they please. The most notable case of this is perhaps Napster, as this platform was taken down after a huge wave of protests to protect the rights of composers. Because of this, most streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music include features that help artists control their music distribution and monetization. Therefore, it's almost impossible to pirate music now, unlike in the 2000s. 

To summarize, illegal Internet downloads can and have caused a ton of issues regarding piracy and monetization, but they helped push the development of tools to ensure these issues never happen again. Therefore, it's safe to say that illegal downloads aren't an issue in the modern world.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people think that increasing business and cultural contacts worldwide have positive influences on development; others think that they have negative effects on national identities. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.""","In the globalized society, the issue of increasing business and cultural communication worldwide has sparked considerable debate. Some contend that exposure to the culture of other countries too much will greatly negatively affect the acknowledgement of domestic history and culture. I strongly agree that increasing communication among countries fosters development both in personal and professional settings. 

Opponents show concern about the fade of national identity by exposure to increasing cultural connections as the history and culture of the native country tend to be easily forgotten by the invasion of the exterior culture. For example, along with the increasing exposure to Western culture, most young adults are more likely to celebrate Christmas instead of some Chinese traditional festival since some young people are obsessed with the unknown culture. They might know the origin of Santa but they have no idea of the origin of the Dragon festival.

Proponents, as I am in favour of, hold the view that emphasizing  communication worldwide positively cultivates  development at individual, enterprise and country levels. At the individual level, worldwide information exchange and multiple languages communication improve the ability of critical thinking and academic learning. At the enterprise level, the popular trend of international trade and international companies provide more employment opportunities domestically. Moreover, the GDP of one country will also be fostered by increasing economic benefits of importation and exportation. Moreover, while young people are attracted to other cultures, the root cause is the lack of propaganda of their conventional culture and civilization. Under positive public guidance, such cultural erosion will be mitigated to some extent. 

In conclusion, while increasing communication in business and cultural settings has some negative effects on the acknowledgement of national identity so far, the positive effect outperforms its drawbacks by improving the personal and country development under correct guidance.","**Task Achievement:**

The range of technology available to people is increasing the gap between the rich and the poor. Others think it has an opposite effect. Discuss both view and give your opinions.,"In today’s world, the impact of technology on income inequality is a topic of intense debate. Some believe it widens the wealth gap, while others argue it can bridge it. This essay explores both viewpoints to assess the complex relationship between technology and socioeconomic disparities.

On the one hand, technology can amplify the wealth gap as affluent individuals and well-funded corporations can employ automation and artificial intelligence in the workplace. This allows them to reduce labor costs, leading to job displacement and wage stagnation for the working class. For instance, in manufacturing, advanced robotics and automation can replace human workers, leading to job loss and downward pressure on wages, while the companies get the benefits of cost savings and increased profits. This automation-driven wealth accumulation can leave many individuals and communities struggling to keep up economically.

On the other hand, technology can be a powerful tool in reducing income disparities. The digital revolution has made information and education more accessible. The advent of e-learning platforms and open-source educational resources allows individuals from economically disadvantaged backgrounds to acquire valuable skills, enhancing their employability. Additionally, technology facilitates innovative solutions to societal issues, exemplified by telemedicine, which provides cost-effective healthcare options to underserved communities, effectively bridging the healthcare disparity. The widespread use of smartphones has also created opportunities for micro-entrepreneurship and access to financial services, empowering individuals to improve their economic well-being.

In conclusion, the impact of technology on the wealth gap is a complex and multifaceted issue. Its potential to either widen or narrow the wealth gap depends on how we approach its development and distribution, emphasizing access, education, and opportunities for all.","### Task Achievement:

"some people think watching TV is bad for children,while others think that watching TV has more beneficial effect on children. discuss both views and give your opinion","While a group of people claim that the time spent  watching television is detrimental for youngsters, others argue that this trend is advantageous for them. Both approaches have their own shortcomings and merits in association with children and it is my firm belief that streaming TV is not doing any good to the juveniles.

To start with, the TV has long been a reign of traditional information radiators in the world, a source of reliable data to  many. Likewise, TV streaming services are considered  one of the most effective methods to raise kids at home regardless of the difficulties. For instance, they can learn the fundamentals of the world by closely engaging with captivating documentaries and series. On top of that it is an additional booster to the youth to hone their social and learning skills just through sitting in front of television programs. 

On the other hand, there are some people who oppose the idea of watching television and its negative impact on children. The first reason why some people evaluate streaming television as  a waste of time for younger generations. Furthermore,  after watching television for a certain amount of time, children become addicted to streaming these shows perpetually. In addition to ,that they also get exposed to  censored views without even a restriction which poses a direct threat to their healthy development to become a successful individual in today's society. 

From my perspective, I strongly believe that the members of the younger generation can agree with me in this matter in which young people who are more vulnerable to the changes that are occurring in the surrounding echo system, should stay away from streaming excessive Television though some kids can benefit greatly.

To sum up, although some side effects in either realm, psychological or physical aspects, can be experienced by the young, they would be eradicated if supervising control can be considered by seniors, prohibiting them from violence for example. Thereby, through watching  fruitful programmes children can broaden their horizons about the world.","**Task Achievement: 7**

Some people believe that climate has the greatest affect on people's way of life. Others believe that the economy of a region has the greatest effect. This is both the views and give your opinion.,"Some argue that climate is the main factor determining people's way of life, while others think the economy of a region is the most important. I agree with both suggestions and I will explain afterwards with my opinion.

On the one hand, climate is a strong power that changes many parts of our lives. It decides what we can grow, what animals we can grow, and how much water we have. The climate also affects the kind of clothes and houses we need. For example, the public in hot, sunny places lives differently from those in cold areas. Where it rains a lot, society often relies on farming, whereas in dry places, they might depend on things like tourism for money.

On the other hand, the economy in a place really changes how people live. In areas with lots of money, pupils can get better schooling, healthcare, and jobs. A strong economy creates more progress better buildings, more jobs, and a higher standard of living. For instance, in cities with a strong economy, you'll find new buildings, lots of job options, and a good way of life.

In my opinion, both the climate and the economy have a big role in how people live. Climate can decide what you can grow or raise, but the economy gives us the money and chances to live well. In places with a strong economy, people can bring food from other places or use technology to handle climate challenges.

In conclusion, both climate and the economy matter a lot. Climate affects what is possible, but the economy gives us what we need to live well. The balance between these two things decides how good life is in a place.","**Task Achievement:**

Films and computer games containing violence are popular. Some people say they have negative effects on society and should be banned. Others say they are just harmless relaxation. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"It is a reality that violent movies and video games are becoming prevalent in modern society. While some contend that it has detrimental effects on people and society and ought to be outlawed, others think that these activities are simply good ways to unwind. I concur with these points of view and will talk about them in this post.

On the one hand, youngsters often mimic violent behavior they see in movies or video games, which is one of the main reasons why they have a negative impact on society. For instance, children are drawn to the dramatic violence and interest in these violent video games, particularly Counterstrike, and desire to practice their actions in real life. The second explanation is that youngsters are more likely to develop a gaming addiction. Children are consequently too lethargic to engage in outside activities and would develop obesity.

On the other hand, the benefits of movies and video games for society come from the fact that kids can refuel after watching or playing them. For instance, many individuals unwind by watching esport tournaments, which are developed annually with the aim of entertaining people and promoting video games worldwide. Additionally, these violent movies and activities, particularly the games, may aid in the development of new friendships for the children as well as enhance cognitive plasticity.

Although technological advancement can aid in accomplishing tasks that humans cannot do, I think that it will give rise to theunemployment.

On the one hand, machines have the ability to go beyond the radar of where humans can reach. This comprises some challenging sectors like mining or working in countries with harsh weather conditions. Furthermore, the usage of machines can mitigate any kind of the risks involved with the human body. Moreover, artificial intelligence can help to detect information at a high pace compared to the human brain. For example, many low-wage workers from Nepal who work in the Middle East countries lose their lives due to extreme weather or falling off from a height. Hence, to  safeguard the lives of people, robots can be an alternative.

On the other hand, robots, if offered as an alternative, will take away the jobs of the public. Due to extensive technological upgrades, not only the white-collar employees, but all kinds of workers fear losing their income. For example, Naulo, a Nepali restaurant, has robotic waiters. This influenced other restaurant owners too as it attracts customers. As a result, waiters protested against all this strategy. Henceforth, technology serves as a bane to the citizens.

Those  who consider robotics to be vital for the advancement of civilization, do so by observing several quality-of-life changes brought by it. Such as, the integration of rudimentary assembly line machines used for product manufacturing. Moreover, there exist self-driving cars, waiting to revolutionize methods of transportation. Additionally, there have been major strides in the development of life-like androids. All in all, the future seems bright indeed according to these supporters.

However, trepidatious ones vouching against this technological progress, do so by witnessing drawbacks brought by these gizmos. Like, mass lay-offs caused by the introduction of automatic tools in many factories around the world. Furthermore, these people do not look favourably at the idea of automation in vehicles, as they are wary of hazards associated with it. Also, they hold fast to the belief that, there will come a day when automatons will completely render human talent superficial. As an example, the advent of artificial intelligence art (AI art) has filled artists around the globe with dread, as they think that they will soon be replaced by their man-made counterparts.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"While there is an increasing concern that technological advances increase the gap between the affluent and the poor people, some people argue that technological change narrow this gap. This essay would discuss both perspectives as well as state my opinion for the former one.

On the one hand, technology exacerbates between the wealthy and the poor. Technological advancements might lead to job replacements in some current areas. The demand for highly-skill workers in some fields such as artificial intelligence or data analysis increase whilst lower-skilled jobs may see reduced demand. As a result, people who do monotonous and repetitive jobs will lose their jobs and result in income inequalities. Furthermore, the limited access to technology among the disadvantaged hinder them from benefiting technological advancements. Many technological products are prohibitively expensive and only the rich can afford to buy them. 

On the other hand, proponents of the opposing view contend that technological advancements are reducing income inequality. Technological change enables all individuals, irrespective socioeconomic background, to access education and services with affordable price. Consequently, the poor also have a better chance of landing a high-paid job, leading to increased income and a higher living of standard. In addition, technological advances increase productivity in wide range of fields. This might lead to the demand for job in many industrial zones increase and the poor can improve their income.

Furthermore, in some cases, young people will face other severe issues connected with losing their vision clearness, so at the end of the day, they will have to wear glasses in order to correct their vision and see the objects around them clearly. Another key problem that could be brought about by playing computer games is addiction. Children do not have highly developed brains to protect themselves from the mental issues that they could face by being in virtual reality non-stop. As a result, many parents ought to monitor their children in order to prevent them from being addicted and committing suicide, for example.  

On the other hand, when children spend their time by forming strategies in order to complete the next level of the game, they surely become more responsible for the result and gain important skills such as strategic thinking and tactic vision which might be helpful for them in their study in the university and the future life, and I agree. By being involved in the process of building a strategy and being responsible for the results, children will be aware of the future consequences of their failure. Moreover, playing video games encourages some young people to be interested in coding and software development and, probably, choose it as their future major in university.

Films and computer games containing violence are popular. Some people say they have negative effect on society and should be banned. Others say they are just harmless relaxation. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Movies and computer games contain violence. Few individuals assume they have a negative impact on society and should be banned.while others claim they are just a source of relaxation. I think this demerits because many movies are very informative for every people , while the masses also face many interpretations by watching violent films due to criminal advertisements.

Movies and computer games can be proved constructive in many terms of learning others' opinions , language as well as culture and with providing society with  a great massage. It means, gaining knowledge they can use where they want. Secondly, due to a swamped ,schedule everyone needs relaxation and a refresh of the brain. For instance, people can spend some quality time with their friend's members by watching films  and children spend time with their friends by playing computer games. As well as child's brains become sharper by playing games As a result, they relieve stress by watching movies as well as they can share movie experiences with others.

Due to spending more time on computer games children become lazy because they do not take part in outdoor activities. In other words, nowadays children easily develop violence by watching movies because they have not majority that what is good for them or not. To quote an example, rap is increasing dramatically because mostly in movies have this scene.Therefore, They do crimes at school with friends.

Some people believe that climate change has the greatest effect on people’s way of life. Others believe the economy of the region has the greatest effect. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.,"Many topics we can gain from newspapers or social media and climate change is one of them. Nowadays, plenty of people assume climate change can increase the temperature of the earth so it forces people to adapt with that situation. Furthermore, the economy in the place where we live also makes us adjust our lifestyle to be fit with our environment. 

Climate change has been a hot topic lately since it gives great impact on humans and the most noticeable problem is an increasing of earth temperature. In Indonesia for instance, people who live in Bandung, which is known as highland, need Air Conditioner (AC) and it's an adaptation done by humans to keep feeling cold. Climate change not only can affect temperature but also it makes messy weather schedule.This random weather creates new habits that are made so people can go their whole lives without being bothered by the weather.  Workers who always bring their umbrella and consume vitamins are behaviors that came from random weather problems.

People who live in Jakarta and people who live in Semarang surely has different lifestyles and it because the rate of economy there. Region where have high rate economy make sellers can sell their products with high price as they know people who live there can afford to buy it. Same way of selling can not applied in low rate economy region. That different makes people need to adjust their lifestyle to place where they live. For example, Semarang people only need Rp 10.000 to get Nasi Padang (Indonesia traditional food) but in Jakarta you need to spend as much money as Rp 15.000 to get the same food. Not only that, the economic rate in a region also give impact to the government about the tax rate. 

Either climate change and region economic rate can affect people’s live. In my own opinion climate change give more impact compared region economic rate since climate change could involve to world community but region economic rate only affects that region.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people are of the view that students should keep a gap of one year without study between school and university. While others think it affects learning.  

Discuss both viewpoints and give your opinion by giving relevant reasons and examples.","University submission is perhaps time-consuming for people, and some think it will be beneficial if a gap year system is applied between the last year in senior high and the university application period.However, there are parts of the community that think the gap year policy will degrade students' ability to learn. This essay will discuss further two perspectives regarding the one-year gap scheme and illustrate each case.

On one hand, gap year regulation gives both parents and students time in preparing the application requirements thoroughly. In fact, kids are enforced to meet the qualification where they have to be  straight-A students in class as well as involved actively in the community. Apparently, being a part of  society consumes  extra time and some children are prioritised to have an extra lesson instead. For instance, some children who are not prepared for an exam tend to take the private lessons outside school time which obviously affects their availability in taking volunteering in their neighbourhood. As a result, their submission process might be affected due to this situation. Therefore, the gap year system will suit high schoolers who want to continue their study.

On the other hand, some might think this system is reckless where children might be affected and loosen their strategy through university. It is understandable that youngsters are unstable especially if they are not encouraged. Giving them a space of time is a bit risky from some perspectives. To illustrate, after graduation, there will be no formal supervision for the kids which means some can lose their motivation and spirit during the period of preparation. Although they are grownups, their instability dominates in decision-making. Instead of being well-prepared, a gap year might impact their enthusiasm to learn.

To conclude, gap year regulation impact differently amongst children. It might be a positive decision where students focus on one activity at a time resulting high acceptance rate in university. Nevertheless, it might affect negatively youngsters which impacts their learning processes.","## Task Achievement:

some people  think that robots are very important to humans future development  while others think they are dangerous and have negative effects on society . discuss both views and give your opinion,"Some argue that machines with artificial intelligence are critical to improving people's futures, while others argue that the invention of robots is a risk that can have negative consequences for society.I believe robots are crusial becouse without robots we cannot be achive the production that is required.

In many countries, robots have become crucial to the development of the economy as they engage in not only manufacturing but also service industries. Robots can survive in conditions that humans cannot, for example,roots are working in a mining area where the air contains poisonous gases and they extract valuable resouse to use for human  . In addition, automated machines are used in car manufacturing because they can work long hours continuously and, in most cases, are more effective than humans.Therefore, global productivity has increased significantly, which is good for future human development. I believe this is a great advantage of robots.

On the other hand, robots can be used in military and anti-social tasks such as causing harm to people and other tasks because the machines only obey their owner's rules and may not consider human feelings or other humans' values. For example, a major Japanese corporation built military robots; after an experiment, they deactivated those robots; however, one of the robots automatically reactivated and connected to the Internet to gather information and become stronger.I believe that this negative impact of rebots can be eliminated by taking strong regulatory measures

In conclusion, robots can positively influence human future  development by increasing global productivity; however, they might be dangerous unless controlled by the govenment .","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think that robots are very important for human’s future development. Others, however, think that robots are a dangerous invention that could have negative effect on society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The phenomenon of the effects of robots technologies development has aroused wide concern among various circles. Divergent as people's views on the issue in question may be, I believe that it is more beneficial for humans in the future.

On one hand, some people think robots will take their job away because the expenditure on robots is noticeably less than human salary. For instance, the basic cost between machines and human has dramatically different. Machines only need fuel and time-to-time maintenance, but a human requires much more, ranging from housing, food, and clothes to transportation. It reflects a company's spending on machines and humans respectively. As a result, some people strongly reject the development of robots.

On the other hand, I believe that automatons can bring us a more wide range of benefits. One of the advantages is that they can work in dangerous environments such as clearing the wall of tall buildings and deforestation. This will in turn prevent the accident occur. Another reason is better shipping efficiency with lower prices, it is beneficial to most businesses these days. For example, automatons shipping can run 24 hours a day which means the period of delivery will be decreased, and the price should be able to cut off half of the original shipping cost because it does not need to pay salary to a machine. Therefore, many people feel that robot development can bring us a better future.

Under this line of thinking, although there is a good reason in favour of the argument that robots are dangerous inventions for our future, I believe automatons development would replace us to finish the most basic work and allow people to live their own life.","### Task Achievement

Human activities have led negative effects on plant and animals all over the world. Some people think it is too late to do something about it. Others think there is still some time to take actions. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"The topic of the effect on plants and animals has been controversial. Some people believe that it is late to take action, whereas I agree with those who think that It is not too late to do something.

One of the most important reasons why people have thought that it is too late to take action is that  capitalism has taken over many places for constructing the building since the government has not taken any responsibility. For example, according to the latest research study conducted by David Hunter Browns, Professor of Bangkok University, It was revealed that one of many countries in Africa's authority would not be able to give a hand to handle  capitalism. This example shows that capitalism plays a major role in emission and that it has an effect on those lives

On the other hand, it seems to me that It is not too late to do something. The most significant reason is the fact that the government is supposed to have responsibility. This is because the government has more power to handle and is the biggest key. To illustrate this, In recent news, in many countries in Europe, governments have been taking project for capitalists, they can obtain incentive if they are willing to reduce emissions. I agree with this point because it is one of the solutions

"Some people think that children should not watch television because it has negative effects, while others believe that televison helps children. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Globally, a few humans believe that youngsters should use television but others do not have the same thoughts. TV is a good tool for learning in this generation since technology has become significant presently. Its bad effects cannot  be overlooked. I think its utilisation for youngsters is essential for their mental development.

    To begin with, viewing a TV set has a positive impact on the intellectual development of a child. It prompts them to challenge their brains and generate ideas especially while seeing educational channels like lingo kids.Certain situations have shown improvements in learning grammar if a kid is consistent in watching English programmes. In ,addition it serves as a form of entertainment for lads during holiday periods. For example, videos and cartoons are basic measures of fun.The role of screens is important in every child's development.

       The universal use of home screens has contributed to reduced morals exhibited by juveniles of today. A lot of adult shows are aired freely and these children have the freedom to watch them. Recent statistics have shown that about 50- 60% of users of porn hub sites are humans of age 9 to 14.Furthermore, it is time-consuming. A minor spends about 5 hours watching channels and this time could be used for other valuable activities such as domestic chores.

     In my opinion, visualising TVs has shown to be essential to optimal brain activities of children. Younger ones who view educative channels regularly have more confidence in dealing with life challenges.For instance, seeing people do debates on Sets gives children the confidence that every idea is valid.Also, televisions are used for virtual feedback for young lads with cerebral palsy. Thus the use of home screens by boys and girls is a significant part of growth.

      In conclusion, the good effects of viewing TV sets by children are very essential in this modern world although their bad factors are there too.Subsequently, every offspring is encouraged to see home screens for at least 30mins to 1 hour daily.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people say that the best way to improv public health by increasing sports facility, others however say that they would have little affect on public health and other majors are required. 
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","It is true that most crowds think that the best way to improve well-being is through sports facilities while others say other factors are responsible for public fitness.In this ,essay we will discuss both these views.

Firstly,play increase the strength of the masses.To explain,it has been seen that sportsmen are more healthy and fit. The chances to catch an infection are minimal. They eat healthy food and exercise daily. Moreover,they are more conscious about their health.For example,it has been seen that the body of sportsmen is more in shape and they have well stamina.As a result,parents involve their children in some kind of activities for their overall development.

Secondly, better medical procedures are also responsible for good strength.To epitome, Governments should provide the best medical treatment to all populations at a reasonable price.These medical facilities should not bond to a particular group.This profession is treated as a charity rather than a profitable business.For instance,  America, Canada and other European countries  provide free medical treatment to their society because they knew  human values.Hence,India gained such  popularity in the medical field that nations all over the world come here for  medical treatment as it is comparatively less expensive.

Thirdly, the masses should be aware.Administrators and Institutions create awareness programs among crowds regarding various diseases timely which will help them to prevent  various diseases.For instance, the Indian government advertise so many well-being-related problems and their solutions that now to some extent these problems are solved.

"Some people say that the best way to improv public health by increasing sports facility, others however say that they would have little affect on public health and other majors are required. 
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","The increasing sports facility is believed by some community to make an improvement on society's health, but others believe that public facility has little impact on public health and need more facility except sports facility. I believe that sports centre is really needed for improving society's health.

There are several ways that are able to lift public health, and making business facilities is one of the paths that can improve the well-being of society. To take an example, the population who live in a good environment have a higher healthy index than people who live in poverty areas. As a result, some researchers are believed that a sports centre is needed to boost people's health.

On the other hand, some groups believe that public facility has no impact on civilization's healthy. They assume that doing exercise in a sports centre is not the only way to build a healthy body. Eating healthy food and living a healthy lifestyle are  examples of it. Moreover, recently people are busy and they do not have time to practice.

I assume that sports centre is an imperative aspect for modern people. Folk should keep their body healthy by doing exercises in sports facilities such as running, swimming and fighting. If the authority makes a lot of sports facilities, the nation's health will increase faster than before.

To conclude, sports facilities are really needed for increasing the healthy index, and I believe that government should make a numerous sport place to reach a healthy civilization.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think watching TV is bad for children, while other think that watching TV has more beneficial effects on children. Discuss both views and give your opinion","Everything has two sides. In terms of watching tv, some believe that it has a good effect on kids. But, on the other hand, many believe that this will generate bad result for children.

For people that think tv will bring beneficial effects for children, they might be thinking that tv shows will give wider range of information for kids. For example, the child that used to watch documentary movies will have more information rather than the one who does not. Furthermore, through their favourite tv shows kids will find that process of learning more enjoyable and fun. Nowadays, the word has become borderless. It is mean that various information from all over the world is accessible for everyone. Netflix,for example, gives particular tv shows in differents languages for kids in the other countries. This will trigger kids to learn languages in the most enjoyable way.

In contrast, for the others who believe that tv shows will bring worse impact for their children, they were worried that children have tendencious to copy all things that they have seen on tv. This condition will create a big problem in society. For example, kids who used to see action movies are more likely to act violently to their friends or their adults. another example, recently there are more youths who smoke since the early age. This conditions were also believed caused by watching inappropriate tv shows for their age.

On top of that, people have much less time to assist their children in watching tv shows. These conditions are caused by many factors, one of these factors is more pressure in work which will lead people to easier their supervision to their kids. in another case the parents will let their heir watch tv shows as they want, in order to make them calm.

To sum up, in my opinion, tv shows will have a beneficial impact on kids as long as they are accompanied by their parents. Thus, the parent can select appropriate tv shows that inlined with their kid's age. Another method is involving AI programs on their tv, so the tv show will get filtered based on the age of their kids.","## Task Achievement:

Some people say that playing games can be bad for children. Others say that playing computer games can have positive effects on the way children develop. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"With the boom of technology, video games are gaining in popularity among children and young adults. Some hold the belief that playing computer games is beneficial to their development, while the opponents voice their criticism against it due to the health risks it may pose. However, from my perspective, video games significantly impact the child’s growth if played moderately. 

On the one hand, gaming can promote children’s health, whether mental or physical state. These virtual games are capable of easing anxiety and helping tackle some mental health issues due to positive chemicals one’s brain produces when they are playing. Moreover, multiples of games such as Sudoku or online puzzles also foster brain development and enhance thinking capacity. Besides, playing games can be an inventive way of exercising. A case in this point is a game called “Ring Fit Adventure - Nintendo Switch”, which requires players to perform an abundance of physical activities and attacks in-game.

Appealing these health benefits may seem, there are still some potential pitfalls if children play video games too frequently. Even though games are fun and relaxing to some extent, teenagers may still stand a great chance of being addicted. Gaming addiction is detrimental to various aspects of life, ranging from the broken parent-child relationship to poor academic performance. In addition, in 2018, the World Health Organization declared it a serious mental health issue. Furthermore, most children tend to sit in front of the screen for a long time during the game sessions since only an insignificant number of these games are fitness ones. Consequently, they may suffer from eye strain, visual impairments, or other diseases such as obesity.

In conclusion, it is undeniable that playing video games may positively affect a child’s health since it helps them unwind and encourages exercise. However, they should acknowledge the appropriate amount of gaming; otherwise, this can result in severe health hazards.","**Task Achievement: 6.5**

"Some people believe that robots will play an important role in future societies, while others argue that robots might have negative effects on society.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","The last two decades have seen enormous changes in the way people's lives are affected by the expert systems, with many advances in this field. However, while these developments have brought many benefits to the world. Personally I believe that the benefits of the robots are likely to outweigh the negative aspects of it.

Some people believe that there are two main reasons why it could be argued that robots might have adverse effects on society in the future. The main issue is that people feel the robots will have a negative impact on the human workforce. The people will be replaced by machines and this will increase the unemployment rate, it leads to more serious problems such as poverty and increased crimes. Furthermore, physical and health issues are a major concern, so people become less active and this may result in some health problems like obesity.

However, others feel that I would agree with those who argue that robots will play important positive roles in future society. The first role is that robots could operate in locations that humans cannot reach such as exploration of the outer space.  Moreover, robots will be used inside the human bodies for monitoring their health and undertake surgery. The second role that will be played by robots is the helping of elderly and retired people with their daily life activities like cooking and cleaning. Finally, robots could do normal jobs quickly unlike human beings. Robots don not complain or get distracted or tired. They readily work twenty-four hours and require minimal maintenance.

"some people think watching TV is bad for children,while others think that watching TV has more beneficial effects on children. Discuss both views and give your own opinion","Television has become an indispensable part of day-to-day life. Although it is thought that spending time watching television is detrimental for children, some people believe this has more advantages in their development. In my opinion, I strongly consider that media has a negative effect in shaping children's behaviour and character and on the long run has damaging side-effects.

On the one hand, some people voice that screen time is quite harmful for children, and I agree. In other words, spending a considerable amount of time watching programmes reduces the time that is spent on studies, and as a result, they tend to score low grades in academics. Adolescents, for instance, are glued to television spending hours together, thereby lose interest and struggle to concentrate in their studies. Consequently, they end up with poor academic performance and failing to succeed later in life. Moreover, cartoon and animated series target young children, and eventually affects their health as the time spent outdoors is considerably less.

On the other hand, it is believed by some that watching useful programmes has beneficial effects on children. One reason why it is helpful is that it gives them quality leisure time from the highly demanding various subjects. This gives them the chance to take their mind out and enjoy some fun time, and also cultivate their interests by watching suitable series. Another reason is that they could relax at the comfort of their home by watching their favourite shows or scientific programs, rather than venturing out, thereby managing time efficiently.

In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinions, I completely believe that spending time before the big screen has harmful effects on children's life.","**Task Achievement:**

On the one hand, many people aurge that the approach of variety and huge number of programs gives those who watch TV the ability to choose freely bteween movis, talkshows, news, or even crtoon.

Also those people stand on the side of variety as the thought that highten people's intellect by huge amount of information about different aspects in life, such as scientific, sports and current world news.

However, I can see that these ideas are flawed owing to superfacial as well as directed thoughts they provide, programs' maneger are usually aiming to enforce their points of view on the viewer, to attract many observers to his side no matter they offer the truth or not. For instance, those who take the side of governement and encourage what they do all the time, while others who judge the behaviours of countries' presidents at any stage even at important and critical events that need all the citizens to be one hand.

Some people think the increasing business and cultural contact between countries brings many positive effects. Others say it causes the loss of national identities. Discuss both view and give your opinion.,"The era of globalisation has made nations around to globe to become interdependent in terms of politics, education, medicine especially international trade and culture exchange. Many regard that the rise in economic and traditional diversity of one nation possess beneficial impacts upon others. However, some object to this idea because of the visible possibility that indigenous values may be perished. 

        To begin with, numerous developing countries have been experiencing a rise in employment opportunity and a massive economic gains with regard to globalisation. The modern business has now found its capability to approach customers of oversea countries. To clearly explain this, companies possess a greater chance to have their products increased in sales numbers and to modify their items to become more approachable and more versatile. Furthermore, the cultural relationships among countries allow employees to go abroad and learn more new things about their neighbours. For example, the Americans usually take trips to Vietnam to experience a wide variety of exclusive foods and learn about the history of their past rival. These people exploit this prospect to improve their foreign foods’ quality, especially Pho and to enhance USA’s historical educational quality.

       However wonderful the advantages may be, foreign policies may terminate a country’s exclusiveness. Globalization has provided a more diverse world in terms of culture’s quantity. One culture may become dominating and make others disappear. Once the culture of a region completely vanishes, it will reverse the merits which globalization evokes. For instance, if Vietnam’s indigenous food like Pho disappears, the amount of international tourists will disappear. Therefore, the tourism industry in Vietnam will fall into chaos and thereby downgrading the whole economic system.

     In conclusion, though globalisation may benefit countries in terms of the economy, those countries, neglecting its policies about such progress might one day disappear completely off the world map. From my own experience, it is up to every individual’s awareness to not only keeps their identity but also encourages national growth.","**Task Achievement:**

In this essay, I will examine both sides of the argument, as well as give my view.

As for those who believe the benefits to take a handful of responsibilities of children, there are many reasons. Firstly, there is no doubt that youngsters need to be well taught and guided before their growing up and entering their adulthood. Taking more duties would allow them to understand early about the real meaning of it, which will, in turn, prepare them well ahead to be a reliable and responsible person when they turn to adult lives. Moreover, a responsible child in a family also means that they would share some family obligations, hence preparing them to be a great leader or a team player.  

In contrast, other people hold the notion that early responsible child life is harmful to children. For instance, children may appear too young to understand what it takes when comes to responsibility, which may well be added the stress to them, resulting in unnecessarily worrisome and hopeless, which would negatively impact children’s mental development. Besides, they may be able to partially finish the assigned tasks. This might be interpreted as a failure or partial completion, which would cost a shadow in their young minds affecting their later lives. The irony is that they would be less capable of taking responsibilities when they grow up. 

In conclusion, although there are some negative implications, I believe that the positive aspects of children taking responsibility are overweight the negative ones; it would prepare them well to be a responsible person in adulthood.","### Task Achievement:

Some people think that range of technology currently available is increasing gap between rich and poor people. Others think that it is causing the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give ur opinion.,"According to some, the technological revolution is currently creating a huge disparity between the wealthy and un wealthy group of people. While others believe the opposite idea. However, I support the former statement as I strongly believe that the new technological innovation is the paramount reason for creating such differences among people.

 To commence with, technological advancements have drastically changed the world we live in and made our life much more pragmatic than we ever anticipated. Although most of these gadgets are eye catching, most of them are very expensive. Therefore, only affluent population can buy them and those in destitute cannot. For example, in the developing countries, only a few percent of the population can buy iPads, iPhones, mac book, expensive cameras and many more. Not only this, many cannot even afford basic household appliances. They have to perform everything manually. This shows the disparity in the living standard between rich and poor people, which creates imbalances and have detrimental effect. 

From the other perspective, with these advancements, internet has become relatively cheaper. Thus, with the help of different social media platform, the general population can virtually connect and interact with each other. With time, they may develop a bond and friendship. This reduces the segregation created in the society. Furthermore, it gives a platform for every indivisuals to express their feelings and talent, regardless of their background. For instance, many people from poor economic background are currently opening channels in youtube and expressing their talent. Through this they are able to generate income for their family. 

Thus in conclusion, I support the view that these technological gadgets are the main reason for creating differences among different classes of people.","**Task Achievement:** 5.0

"Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?","People have different views when it comes to moving to other countries for a better job opportunity. While some argue that this trend might be harmful to children, others have an opposing idea. Nevertheless, my opinion lies with the latter.

On the one hand, travelling abroad to find a job can harm children in several ways. Firstly, it  may affect children's languages. These children would not be able to speak their mother tongue fluently after staying in a foreign country for a couple of years. The impact would be more prominent when children try simultaneously to learn their first language. Secondly, children would copy the natives' lifestyles, norms and habits, which might not be acceptable based on their original religion. For example, gender equality and homosexuality are considered a sin from Muslim parents' point of view.

On the other hand, moving abroad can bring certain advantages to children. To elaborate, they may have this unique opportunity to learn about new cultures, customs and traditions while  broadening their horizons. Nowadays, knowledge is power and people who know more will have a brighter future, thus, these children would be more successful if they decide to return back to their home due to access to outstanding experiences. Moreover, these children can make plenty of friends while living in a foreign nation. In the upcoming years, when these children will apply for a job, their indigenous friends can be helpful by giving them valuable advice.

In summary, the pattern of moving to another country for work can have positive and negative consequences to children, but I think that its merits outweigh the drawbacks.","### Task Achievement:

"Many people believe that the priority of the government should be to ensure a growing economy. While others believe that the government should focus its efforts on uplifting the less fortunate?
Discuss both views.","A section of the society are ardent believers in government pursuing economic growth as a primary objective. However, the others opine that the government should channelize its efforts on increasing the standards for the under-privileged. Hence, this essay will evaluate both the views of the society. 

On the one hand, having an expanding economy is indispensable in uplifting the living standards of the economy. Firstly, a growing country signifies the increasing amount of output produced. To produce more, one needs a lot of human resources(labour). As a result, unemployment drops in the economy as jobs are created and people have a stable income in order to lead a peaceful and prosperous life. For instance, CNBC reported India’s growing economy has improved their quality of life drastically in the last decade. 

On the other hand, focusing on elevating the poorer section of the society induces a positive outlook of the economy which stimulates tourism. It is often seen not having a poverty-stricken society boosts the number of travellers to that country. Furthermore, tourists opine that they are disinterested and discontented to perceive an environment which has a low quality of life as the particular nation don’t possess the capability of satisfying their needs and wants. For example, a survey released by the CNA revealed that countries living in poverty demotivates tourists to travel to these nations

Some people think competitive sport is important for a child’s education. Others think it has negative effects on children. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"An increasing number of people are concerned about the purpose of teaching sports at schools. Many people believe that schools should offer competitive sports in a curriculum, while others are against it because it may negatively affect children. In my opinion, I would argue that competitive sports should not be allowed at schools as they may bring many drawbacks to children.

It is a belief that competitive sports bring many advantages for children in the future. First, competition is a natural instinct in humans, and it is likely to strengthen children’s personalities. Therefore, competition is healthy because it pushes people to give their best or even over their limitation. Second, children need to experience these competitions at schools. This is due to the fact that when they graduate from schools, they have to step into the real world where people have to compete with one another to get jobs in daily life.

On the other hand, the negative effects of competitive sports should not be overlooked. The first reason is that sports should provide children with a sense of enjoyment rather than competition. Addionally, playing sports with their peers can build their relationships and teamwork skills. If competitive sports are brought to the curriculum, their relationships will be disjointed and fragmented. Another consideration is that playing sports encourages children to have physical and mental development, meaning that they become healthier and may have fewer diseases, such as diabetes. Whereas competitive sports may make them feel stressed because they have to against one another for higher grades.

In conclusion, sports are great activities for children’s development. Personally, I believe that competition in schools brings more harm than benefits.","**Task Achievement:**

"Many people argu that in order to improve educational quality, high school students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Other think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom.

Discuss both views and give your Opinion.","It is obvious that education is directly connected to countries'development so in order to improve a country the educational system must be improved. But it has always been debatable topic how governments should arrange educational policy. Because almost all people have different thoughts on this topic. Especially people comment on connections between teachers and students, it is because of that these two groups play main roles in education. There are different arguments whether students can criticise their teachers or it can be disrespectful. I strongly believe that students are free to tell their own thoughts.

On the one hand, it is true that teachers can be more experienced and mature than students. But it doesn't mean that everything they say is true. Sometimes educated people can also have some mistakes or false beliefs. Or their way of thinking may be different than their students. In that case students should absolutely be free to make their own comments and defend their attitudes. It helps them to be more confident when they express their feelings and thoughts.

On the other hand, those who think it is a reason of losing respect between teachers and their students can be right in some aspects. Generally, students in high schools are not very mature and they can use some rude words in order to express themselves or to criticise someone. Using inappropriate expressions against teacher can cause losing respect to teacher and it would create chaotic classrooms.

"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school  students are encouraged to make comments or even criticism of their teachers.  Others think it will lead to a loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. 
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Many suggest that in the development of learning in classes, pupils shouldn't express any negative comments toward their teachers. Others, however, take a different point of view and emphasise the need for more freedom of expression in classes. In my opinion, it is better for students to have the chance to conceal their thought toward the teachers. 

On one side of this argument, there are people who put forward the view that youngsters should be limited their expression in classes. As it shows unrespect behaviour toward the teachers as well as encourages them to break the classrooms' norms. Since, in many institutions, there are clear guidelines on which ways students should behave, thus allowing them to express everything freely  persuades them to ignore those guidelines. Moreover, they might take this opportunity to be their accuses in defending themselves after doing bad things in academies. Therefore, this claim will have drawbacks for both schools and students. 

In spite of the above argument, I hold the view that educational places should allow students to make comments toward professors. General speaking, whatever positions we have, we could act the wrong way. This statement could be adapted with the teachers, as not every action they require or acknowledges students to do in schools are make sense. For instance, in some Thai schools, teachers haven't provided a gap for pupils to ask questions, so they just talk until the end of the lesson. As a result, the pupils don't understand anything, and finally they got a low grade on the exams.

"Many people argue that in order to improve educational quality, high school students should be encouraged to question and offer criticisms on their teachers. Others think this will lead to a loss of respect and discipline in the classroom.

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","Educational institutes are not only important for the theoretical knowledge that is taught in them but also for the overall development of cognitive and social skills of the students. Some believe that high schoolers should be allowed to cross-question and offer criticisms on their educators while others oppose this notion, as it might lead to poor discipline in schools. In this essay, I will discuss the merits of both  sides of the argument and state my opinion about it.

It is argued, that students should be encouraged to question and criticise what they are being taught as it will help them develop the skill of critical thinking . This will be beneficial to them as they will be able to use this skill to analyze various problems in life and also form their individual opinions.  Critical thinking may also save them from misinformation , for example, when they come across some information or propaganda on the internet. Moreover, the habit of questioning will build curiosity in various subjects and may possibly lead to innovation. 

On the other hand, encouraging such behaviour may lead to these pupils becoming overconfident , resulting in loss of discipline as they might start disrespecting their teachers. They may criticize every statement and instruction given to them, which will lead to the teachers losing control of their classrooms.

Others feel that this would result in a  loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion..","They say that Learning never stops. We learn till our last breath and it is actually responsible to  improve our character, It defines what kind of human being we would be. And now we can see  there’s lot of improvement in learning experience. We have seen evolution from Nature classroom  to Google classrooms.

It has been revolution at every stage in this process and now students  are encourage to evaluate and criticize their teachers, while others feel that it can disturb the  discipline in the classroom.  Teachers are considered to be another parents who gives valuable lessons to child. There has been a  time when all mistakes of teachers were acceptable and unquestionable where teachers were  considered to be dictator and students were following the instructions given by their mentor.  Nowdays this process has been changed drastically and now students has liberty to judge their  teachers and give them feedback which in my perception should be limited at some extent because  there are number of mischievous children in the classroom who can portray wrong image of the  authority and can disturb the environment of study.  In my opinion there should be transparency in the process where we can validate the on going  process like cameras or recordings. In this way authorities can track their own performance and  make changes rather than giving power to developing minds. Also we can practice gaining feedback  from students with limited resources like google feedback forms.

"Some people think the main benefit of international cooperation is in the protection of the environment, while others think that the main benefits are in the world business. Discuss both views and give your opinion.","With the rapid development of globalization in the past decades, many countries get profits due to the increasingly strong bonding through the intensive interaction with others. The environmental protection and economy have equally benefited from such international cooperation under the background in major regions.

On the one hand, it is commonly known that environmental problems have a heavy toll on the well-being of the whole society. Thus,applying global cooperation can unite more countries and clear the responsibilities of each in preventing detrimental pollution. A great case in point is that the developed countries can support many high-tech devices and professional experts in the developing regions to tackle the environmental problems that can not be solved by limited local technology and lacking of biologists and chemists and so on.What is more, a great number of extinction species can also be rescued by the international organisations when they face detrimentally killing result of the lagging traditions in specific areas.

On the other hand, the international connection allows entrepreneurs to extend their businesses out of the country, which could make rational use of different resources to help the economic development on both sides.For example, many western companies set up factories in Asia since there are more low-price labour forces and some factories were set in the original source of goods in order to reduce the transportation cost. What is more,one more beneficial fact caused by international cooperation is that the foreign businesses also create many job opportunities for local citizens in some developing countries where the industrial development is primitive and inferior.

Most of the urgent problems can only be solved with international cooperation. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is generally believed that the majority of urgent issues and disagreements can merely be tackled with global cooperation. I strongly agree with this idea. 

International cooperation plays a vital role in solving problems occurred in any country. In the modern era, the mentioned cooperation is promoted by unilateral agreements signed mostly between more than 150 countries. They are ratified by many states to cooperate in critical topics such as crime and punishment and protection of the environment. Take for instance, with the help of the unity between states, criminals transit to another country in order to escape from justice are caught without large operations and efforts. Therefore, it would be beneficial, especially in certain areas to cooperate internationally. 

Global cooperation also acts as a deterrent, in other words, some disputable and controversial issues before they become an actual dispute are covered in the agreements as well. An interesting study conducted last year suggests that widespread regulations dissuade people from breaking the law. More, social cooperations help conserve world's cultural heritages.  Furthermore, the deterrence saves our money and time as a country, and so administrers can focus on improving public services.

In this essay merits and demerits of both points of view will be discussed.

New tools and inventions in the last century, give people improved methods to store data like text. This way of storage is more intelligent because we can transport these very easily. To illustrate, the transportation of 1000 reports in the past was a really huge work to be done but now we can move them on a CD.

Additionally, they say electronic books do not have the same good feeling as paper books. Also, researches show that concentrating on a subject is more when you read it on paper.

"In the past, people stored knowledge in books. Nowadays people stored knowledge on the Internet.

Thus, the biggest change we can see in the reading habits. People used to read more books to gain knowledge but these days such material is available on their fingertips with the help of internet. In my view, both statements have their own pros and cons.

To begin with, before the internet era one has to carry the weight of books to get the knowledge but with the internet, everything is readily available on their handheld devices. No one has to go anywhere to get the books to study instead, one just need to type in a few keywords and pretty much everything is cooked up for them. To illustrate, when I was in school I had to buy purchase books or borrow from the library but these days children get the same amount of education even with various methods with help of technology. Thus, the internet clearly has changed the conventional way of learning.

In addition to this, the internet has  huge storage to keep data the whole world, whereas  writing in books may fade away. It is an intelligent way to preserve our heritage or other important data for the upcoming generation.

"Leaders and directors in organizations are normally older people. Some people think having a younger leader would be better.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Commonly speaking, heads of institutions are older members of society. According to some people's opinion younger administrators would influence the management system in a better way. I am inclined to agree with both of the ideas for a number of convincing reasons.

The first idea set out can be true for two solid reasons I am about to explain. Since the beginning of humanity elderly people are always respected and almost every idea, they put forward were always supported without any doubt. The second reason, based on a stereotype, is that older members of public are seen as more experienced and omniscient individuals, hence directors of associations, enterprises often found to be older people.

Regarding the second idea that is claimed, I utterly agree that well-educated younger people would make a better leader as they are full of energy, open to endeavor new management techniques for the best of their workplace. For instance, young ambitious worker would go through sleepless nights to create a project that can benefit to the company and their career and that can be realised thanks to their robust health. In my view, this derives from the urge to prove themselves in society as a prosperous young leader.

To sum up, I am in agreement with the opinion that chiefs of people in organizations are generally older people due to their work experience and reputation they collected over the years. However, I also believe that in times of acute competition where everyone is dealing with the modern technology and methods younger generation can overcome the challenge better.","### Task Achievement:

Leaders and directors in organizations are normally older people. Some people think having a younger leader would be better. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued by some that giving power to young people to lead organizations can be more beneficial than letting older people be in charge of leadership. I totally agree with this view because of the following reasons.

I hold a firm belief that younger people can bring many benefits to the development of an organization when they become leaders or managers. First of all, compared with senior people who often suffer from health problems, young people have a competitive edge in terms of youth and physical strength. This means that they are willing to sacrifice time, effort and devotion to work longer hours or build a reputation for their business, which old leaders may find  beyond their ability to do. Besides, with  sensitivity and quick adaptation to changes in the market, young leaders seem to be brave enough to take risks and materialize innovative initiatives. With these differences, young people can lead their organization to a higher level of status and competitiveness in the market.

Some people argue that it would be better for an organization when its leaders or managers are older people. The reason for this argument is because those people are very experienced, which means that they can have a wide vision as well as abilities to predict unexpected setbacks. Thanks to accumulated experience, elderly leaders can orientate their businesses to overcome tough times and gain sustainable development. However, I am more convinced that young people are able to do better than these old directors in a constantly-changing world these days. In fact, the more experienced people are, the more conservative they become. In other words, the conservative nature of elderly seniors can be considered as a hurdle for their adaptation to continuous turbulence in the business practice, hindering the breakthroughs of an organization.

In conclusion, due to the aforementioned reasons in terms of youth and risk-taking nature, young people deserve to be held accountable for leading an organization or a business rather than older ones.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think scientific research should focus on solving world health problems. Others think that there are more important issues.  

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","With the advancement of modern technologies nowadays, people have debated whether scientific studies must aim at finding cures for diseases rather than other areas of concern. This essay will discuss either side and then explain why I prefer for research to give equal importance to all the issues that matter in our society.

To start with, people are suggesting that more thorough research should be spent to deal with the deteriorating health of our society. They are concerned that more and more people are becoming sick thus, focused research must be implemented to have answers to the health problems that our communities are facing nowadays. One good example is the current pandemic. To further elaborate, it has been 2 years since the COVID 19 started and yet, there are still people who die because of the virus. Vaccines may have been invented but it does not necessarily free us from the detrimental effects of this phenomenon.

On the other hand, some are debating that other issues like economic stability, public safety and the likes are equally vital to the health issues that need to be focused on. They believe that being healthy will not be enough to survive thus giving importance to sustainable living and being safe is a must. In particular, having peace of mind, of not worrying about day to day life will give also a healthy life thus life's function should come as equally important.

"Some people think scientific research should focus on solving world health problems. Others think that there are more important issues.  

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Many people believe that scientific research nowadays should concentrate on tackling global health issues. While others and I disagree with the idea and think that there are more vital threats. In the following paragraph, both of these viewpoints will be discussed in detail before the conclusion is reached.

On the one hand, one of the reasons that folk say that research should focus on handling health problems is that these days, there are numerous new illnesses emerging all the time. To illustrate, Covid-19 that is spreading out currently is a disease that humans have not known before. As a result, we have to do research to invent the vaccine to deal with this disease. Moreover, individuals would like to have a longer life. In other words, at present, the average lifetime of humans is seventy years old. Therefore, If medicines and medical treatments are more enhanced, humans will have a longer life.

On the other hand, the obvious reason that some people believe that there are more crucial problems is that presently, there are a lot of environmental threats that affect our lives. For example, air pollution is a significant problem that has severe effects on humans because the fumes emitted from cars can cause  lung disease. On top of that, engineering issue also plays an important role in our lives. That is to say, engineering development such as autonomous cars can make individuals more safe and comfortable.

Fewer young people choose to work in farming. What are the reasons? Should young people be encouraged to do farming work?,"At present, the question of why fewer farms for their livelihoods in the countryside remains a conundrum. I will give my own points about the causes of this trend and whether it is good for youngsters to work in farming.

   Firstly, fewer people do farming jobs in rural areas because those involved are usually underpaid. Consequently, it becomes a real hurdle to lead their family to a happy life while living  a low standard. Everyone desires to have tasty meals, to live in gorgeous houses, to send their kid to well-reputed schools so they would never accept such a low wage . Secondly, extreme working conditions are another burden that people have to take on. For example, when it is in the middle of June, farmers are still in the fields on a daily basis although the weather is rainy which is detrimental to endure. In contrast, even an office worker can get a higher air-conditioned working complex. In other words, this profession is the last choice and people avoid it because making a living seems to be impossible.

    Those above-mentioned pieces of evidence show that there are a lot more well-paid careers for people to choose if they leave the remote area to study in the city. Such as doctors, architecture designers, and other rewarding roles, so I strongly disagree to let  youngsters work in the profession of cultivating. Moreover, if students become farmers, they will waste all the time and money that they spent on academic education because watering and collecting do not need high level of qualification but health, all of their accomplishments at school are unusable then. For instance, unlike farmers, well-educated IT developers can earn much more in a month. In addition, those people also have the  right to experience other perks such as being flexible in working schedules, which farmers could never have .

   In conclusion, there are a few key reasons for the decreasingly attendance to the work that provides agriculture products being little amount of pay and a poor working environment. Due to this, the young should consider having another choice which is more try-worthy with more creature comforts.","## Task Achievement:

It is argued that the parents of children who break the rules should be punished in some ways as parents are responsible for the children's actions. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is widely believed that people should put blame on the parents of those who break the rules. Nevertheless, from my perspective, exerting punishment on parents for their children's wrongdoing is not sensible for a variety of reasons.

To begin with, every individual should be responsible for their own actions. Although fathers and mothers have to take accountability for their children's mistakes in some aspects, the youngsters need to deal with the problems they had caused because each person is a separate individual who has their own thoughts and deeds. Hence, it is morally wrong to blame all the responsibilities on moms and dads. Besides, if parents are in charge of the faults that their children cause, the youngsters will rely on their parents and are not willing to face worthy penalties.

Furthermore, adolescents are influenced by not only their parental behaviours but also other vital factors such as their peers and toxic content on the Internet. In the tech savvy-era, the popularity of social media boosts the anti-social and harmful videos that cause plenty of consequences that fathers and mothers could not control. Those who have curiosities could mimic these criminal activities that they do not have full awareness of. Another reasonable factor that should be concerned is the teenagers' social relationships at school. Friendship plays a crucial role and affects directly children's behaviours and actions. For example, as reported in Times in 2020, there are more than half of teenagers' crimes have the potential root of obeying peers' actions. 

In conclusion, although maternal individuals are the core model and the protectors of their offspring, I am of the opinion that it is unreasonable to accuse them of their children's faulty actions.","**Task Achievement:**

"In recent time economic growth has made some people richer in both developed and developing countries. While studies show that people in developing countries are happier now than before, people in developed countries are no happier than they were before.","Money cannot guarantee people's happiness. It is proved by experts that although economic growth has made people richer, people from developed countries feel less happy than they were before. In contrast, in poor countries, wealth make them happier. I will outline the reason why this phenomenon happened.

In the case of developed countries, they are never starving. In the past, they can found meal everywhere and able to bought it. Before technology advanced, they already went to work such as farming or work in a factory. They had enough money to prevent them from starving. Another reason is the time of working. They worked several hours and have time to take a rest. Meanwhile, in recent year, they work overlap time hours. They have no time to do their interest or go on vacations with their family. It is because of competition among people. Their ambition encourages them to pursue their goal and achievement for enhancing their status.

On the other hand, residents of developing countries feel happier than they were before because they ever lived in a lack of education and food. In the past, it was really hard for them to buy some food and studied in formal education. But today, since they are richer than before, they can get both of those terms. They can buy an important stuff for their life. Another reason is they can manage their time working well, so they still have time to interact with other people.

In conclusion, I must say that what we can learn about two cases above is to love our life.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","There is currently a debate about whether imposing stricter penalties on inappropriate drivers is the sole solution to promoting road safety. I strongly disagree with this statement because, in my view, road safety depends not only on the severity of punishments but also on effective traffic rule enforcement and heightened public awareness.

One compelling reason why I argue that traffic rules play a pivotal role in addressing this issue is that rules form the fundamental framework that shapes societal behavior. Moreover, stringent traffic laws can deter drivers from engaging in dangerous behaviors on the road, thereby fostering a safer driving environment. To illustrate, individuals contemplating driving home after consuming alcoholic beverages, which could lead to accidents, are more likely to reconsider their actions when faced with the consequences outlined in traffic laws. Consequently, rules are instrumental in preventing potentially hazardous situations.

Another key factor supporting my stance is the importance of individual awareness and responsibility in ensuring road safety. Despite the existence of stringent penalties in traffic laws, some individuals continue to flout them. By educating drivers about these laws and cultivating a mindset of respect for fellow citizens on the road, we can significantly improve driver behavior. For example, a well-informed driver with a positive attitude toward road safety is more likely to become a responsible and law-abiding motorist, thereby contributing to a safer traffic environment. Therefore, encouraging a collective commitment to safe driving is paramount in enhancing road safety.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that achieving road safety requires more than just imposing harsher penalties on offenders. It necessitates a multifaceted approach that includes effective traffic rule enforcement and the cultivation of public awareness and responsibility. By addressing these aspects comprehensively, we can work towards building a safer and more secure road environment for everyone.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that the only way to improve safety on our roads is to give much stricter punishments on driving offences. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is a lot of discussion on how to improve security on our roads. Some people think that in order to decrease  the number of accidents there should be stricter punishments for driving offences. Although this might help, I believe that the impact would be minimal. I firmly believe that to increase safety on our commute there should be better planning on how they construct the roads and also in public transportation availability, in this essay I will point out the reasons and examples for my opinion.

First, hefty fines do not always work, one example is how Brazil increased the punishment for drunk driving, increasing the value of the fine and also making it a crime. But this had the initial effect of decreasing the number of driving under influence related accidents, however, over time drivers grew accustomed to it and rates came back to the same levels as before. Also, most municipalities do not have enough resources to diverge to this kind of inspection, making the punishment not as believable.

Secondly, the construction of  roads has a huge impact on how individuals drive. As an example, large lanes might bring a feeling of security to the driver and they might drive with less awareness and not check their speed as often. Therefore, roads that also are made to share the space with cars and pedestrians might have a huge influence on the number of accidents.

Lastly, there are other mechanisms of traffic control and security, that are more effective and cheaper than fines. One of the main ones is investing in public transportation. Taking people out of the cars and making them use public buses or trains put more professional drivers on the road and remove more aloof from the roads,  thus decreasing the risk of accidents.

In conclusion, although stricter punishments might look like a good solution, they would have an effect only in the short run. For more lasting effects the design of roads and also how public transportation is available to have a more effective impact.","### Task Achievement:

THE ONLY WAY TO IMPROVE ROAD SAFETY IS TO GIVE MUCH STRICTER PUNISHMENTS ON DRIVING OFFENCES. TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU AGREE OR DİSAGREE?,"In the last few years, the debate regarding road safety has been raised. Some people claim that the only way to increase  road security is to have strict rules and punishment systems. However, I believe that such measures will not be enough and we need more actions to tackle this problem. 

Firstly, the government should have the responsibility for ensuring that the country has a safe route according to the standards. For example, in the major cities, we should have huge roads then small network routes. In addition, roadway maintenance should occur frequently in order to avoid accidents. Furthermore, we should have a national roads safety committee that will inspect and standardize the traffic safety issues. For instance, the committee will give guidelines to be followed as well as training to the inspectors to monitor the progress. 

Secondly, the government also needs to make clear traffic rules and distribute them to the people. In other words,  theoretical knowledge should be included in driving lessons. In addition, such knowledge should be distributed to all roads users. Thirdly, the presence of traffic lights is essential to allow smooth movements of the vehicles. All of that together with a strict punishment system will decrease  accidents and promote roads safety. 

In conclusion, to decrease the accidents and make sure the security of motor traffic, cyclists and pedestrians we should have excellent roads as well as a formal committee that responsible for the guidelines. In addition to a strict fines system. Also,  a theoretical exam should take place for all driving students.","### Task Achievement:

Some people think that young people should be required to do unpaid work helping people in the community. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"There is a widespread belief that voluntary community work should be mandatory for young individuals.  Although charity work does provide some value, I am more convinced that forcing them to take part in these activities is rather unfair.

To begin with the positives, a crucial advantage of unpaid services is that they inculcate a high sense of responsibility towards the community among teenagers. Indeed, without involving in charitable organizations, they miss the chance to experience and gain insight into the underprivileged in real life. As a result, they would not propose adequate solutions to solve these social problems in the future. Furthermore, a volunteer program is a chance for youngsters to develop various skills, which can be seen as a beneficial asset for their resumes. For instance, their communication and teamwork skills can be improved when they collaborate with friends to help the elder or orphans.

However, there are still some disadvantages when forcing young people to take part in unpaid jobs. Firstly, the time devoted to community services can be time-consuming. Undoubtedly, students have to set aside their studying time to join these activities. The second drawback is that if this policy is mandatory, it can pose a stressor for the young generation. Besides studying, most of them already have multiple responsibilities to tend to, like developing their own project, working part-time, or implementing the activities of their club. Adding public service as an obligation will make them feel being stripped of their freedom. Then, the values of voluntary spirit will be lost.

In conclusion, despite some benefits in terms of a sense of responsibility and skill development, charity services are still overshadowed by the downside.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be

done by artificially intelligent robots.

What is your opinion?","Artificial intelligence and its impact on employment is increasingly becoming a hot topic of debate. While a number of people believe that artificially intelligent robots will replace humans to do all jobs in the long term, there are many who have opposing views. This essay will argue that eventually, most jobs will indeed be done by robots powered by artificial intelligence although not all jobs as believed by some.

Around the world, giant strides have been made with regards to the capacity of artificial intelligent robots to carry out complex tasks typically done by humans in industries like manufacturing, shipping and information technology. These robots are consistently demonstrating higher efficiency levels with cheaper overhead costs than their human counterparts, causing many industry leaders to cut down on their human workforce in favour of adopting robotic systems. For example, Tesla, the global leader in electric vehicle manufacturing, recently announced plans to lay off 20% of its workforce as well as plans to build two new factories across North America that will be fully operated using robots powered by artificial intelligence. Many more of such announcements are expected in the coming decades, corroborating the belief that human beings will be made redundant as more artificially intelligent robots replace them at their jobs. 

However, not all occupations can be efficiently done by these robots. Professions such as prostitution, policing, marketing and customer service require human factors such as empathy and emotions to be delivered efficiently. For instance, studies show that many customers prefer to interact with a human customer service agent over the phone to help resolve their problems, rather than interact with a non-human system. To sum it up, artificial intelligence may never be able to replicate the human factors listed and as such cannot perform tasks that require these factors. 

This essay has argued that artificial intelligence robots will eventually be able to do most jobs and also touched on the fact that not all jobs can be done by these robots. In my opinion, a lot of jobs will be done by robots in the long-term but not all jobs.","## Task Achievement: 7

In the past, skill was a necessary qualification for any occupation, and any type of job had to be done manually by humans such as an accountant or an analyzer. This type of employee has to be very intelligent and concentrated in their job, if there is any error it would cause the accuracy and damage the company's reputation.

many universities professional cannot find the jobs in their choosen profession.what factors may have cause this situation and what in your opinion should be done about it.,"It has been universally acknowledged that the problem of unemployment among university graduates is escalating at an alarming rate in the current scenario. This issue has been a depressing magnitude. Although a plethora of reasons are there yet some sensible solutions are also available to curb this grave issue.

To commence with  the first and foremost cause,  is a lack of professionalism because colleges  do not teach pupils about the value of being well-behaved at job interviews. Moreover, teachers in educational institutes focus on covering the topics in the syllabus and train students to achieve good grades . Undoubtedly,  a number of learners graduate from top universities  with excellent grades. However, they end up being unemployed due to a lack of knowledge about job opportunities, interview criteria and resumes. To illustrate, in developed nations, multinational companies recruit candidates based on their resumes, interviews and experience in the past and according to a survey majority of people are not called in for hiring events because of the unprofessional format used to make resumes. Hence, being a bookworm is not worth it as communication skills and a number of other personality traits can help to achieve  a reputable position.

Moving toward the ideas that can curb this issue, the best solution to this problem is to make it compulsory for educational institutes to introduce a course in the graduation program in which students will be taught about the proper format of making resumes. In addition, interview practices should be a part of the syllabus and the skills of making connections with people in their field should be taught. For instance, a survey was conducted and it showed that people who took extra courses to learn resume-making and to practice job interviews were able to gain jobs in their fields. Consequently, learners will gain confidence and will gain  an idea of real-world competition in finding jobs.

To recapitulate, without any doubt, this problem has become a burning question of the day. Therefore, educational authorities should come forward to mitigate this complex problem.","## Task Achievement:

Many people have jobs that involve working shifts (i.e. working at night). What are some of the problems that shift workers might face? What can be done to solve them?,"There is no denying that working shifts might be harder than other regular jobs. This essay is intended to analyze the several drawbacks this category has to face daily, as well as to suggest some solutions to reduce the burden on workers. 

Firstly, there are numerous issues when considering working shifts. In fact, if it is not always pleasant to work, it is much less enjoyable when it is due during nights, bank holidays or weekends. While ordinary employees have the chance to spend festive moments with friends and relatives, healthcare workers, to give an example, are going to the hospital. Year after year, these missed precious moments contribute to a potential burn-out. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that working at night alters the circadian rhythm, which has negative consequences on the physical and psychological sphere. To conclude, these are just a few of the innumerable concerns shift workers have to deal with.

On the other hand, there are different solutions to at least sweeten shift-workers'workers conditions. For instance, an economic incentive should be given to them, especially when considering weekends and bank holidays. In addition, the number of wards should be limited following the guidelines written by the Society of occupational medicine. Finally, extra days off should be guaranteed, in order for workers to spend a proper amount of time with families and friends while they are not sleeping, as well as to profit from daylight to accomplish ordinary tasks. Perhaps, with those suggestions they might cherish their employment a bit more. 

To conclude, there are countless cons to working during shifts. However, there are luckily a bunch of options, alternatives and ideas to ameliorate the condition of this essential class of workers.","## Task Achievement:

WHAT IS YOUR OPINION?","These days with the advent of new technologies such as AI, a lot of people have lost their businesses and have been replaced by them. Someone may say that this process will continue, resulting in the loose of all the jobs. While others say that there are professions that only living humans can do. I agree with the latter opinion and process this view in this essay. 

 Most importantly, professions dealing with feelings are difficult to be managed by AI. It is a privilege for human beings to be moved, shocked or angry and needless to say, those emotions can not be understood by artificially made things. For example, jobs such as mental counsellors can not be replaced. This is because there are no patterns or concrete solutions that can be applied to a mental problem. Problems regarding sentiments are always different and so the solutions are uncountable like stars. It is impossible for AI to deal with it using a pattern programmed previously. 

 On the other hand, someone may say that if we give all the accumulated information about a job, AI will be able to run the work. I agree to some extent but the more jobs AI steals, the more works people will nurture. AI is special in that it can use effectively all the past information. However, it is unable to make new things because it lacks creativity. Therefore, only humans are able to make innovations and innovative jobs can not be replaced by humans. 

 In conclusion, AI will never replace all jobs because it can not understand feelings and give birth to innovations.","**Task Achievement: 7**

"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. 

What is your opinion?","As technology continues to advance, the majority of the jobs in future will be done by machines with artificial intelligence. Robots possibly can take most of the jobs; however, it is highly unlikely that occupations that require human contact can be substituted. This essay will discuss, why most of the jobs will be automated and only a few will be carried out by humans.

Automation is becoming increasingly prevalent and is likely to have a significant impact on the labour jobs market that does not require specific and complex human skills. Many companies will turn to artificial intelligence to automate processes and increase  efficiency as it is far less expensive than hiring, training and employing a human. For example, in many countries car wash stations have been automated that cost far less than employees. In addition, these stations work around the clock and require no vacations or holiday pay. For these reasons, occupations that can be automated will be replaced.

Conversely, there are some occupations that require a human touch and for this ,reason can not be replaced by artificial intelligence. These jobs include education, medicine, psychology and social work to name but a few. Robots will never be able to achieve the social and emotional capabilities that are required to perform these jobs.

To conclude, a significant number of human jobs will be conducted by robots in the future. While robots can take over the labour market jobs , occupations that require human skills will always exist. Ultimately, skilful jobs which are effectively done by people may not be done  by machines.","### Task Achievement:

Some believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"In all countries around the globe armed police personnel are common. However, the necessity of arming them is debatable. Some people claim that it leads to the unprecedented attack on common people and perhaps to state terrorism and violence, while I concur with the side of those who argue that it is essential to maintain law and order. The reasons are manifold for my support  will be discussed in this essay. 

On the one hand, I totally disagree with the notion that state terrorism is raising because of armed police officers. In fact, many people who believe this notion are not ready to understand the fact that the police department is directly controlled by the home department of government. And thus there are myriad public councils are working to strictly monitor the judicial use of these weapons by police officers. Additionally, these people often come with an example of some random police encounters with common people. Although these incidents are true, I believe these are mostly accidental and the police officers who are responsible for these also have been punished severely for their negligence. 

On the other hand, the country's entire internal security management is under the control of the police department. In order to maintain these superiorly, they are in the need to develop some sort of fear among people. This fear in my opinion is healthy for the betterment of society. Furthermore, police and state security forces are the first-line workers who need to witness some dangerous situations. Despite their personal well-being, they work towards the welfare and security of the people. For example, recently one of the police inspectors in my neighbourhood was brutally attacked by some petty thieves during a situation when he tried to arrest them for shoplifting. This incident made me  think in favour of armed police officers that if he was allowed to carry his weapon, he would have got prevented  the attack. 

In conclusion, not only do armed police officers use their weapons to maintain law and order, but also for their self-protection. Therefore, I totally agree that arming  police officers will never lead to state terrorism or violence, in fact, it prevents these.","**Task Achievement: 5.5**

The essay addresses the prompt by providing an opinion on the necessity of arming police officers. However, the response is not fully comprehensive as it primarily focuses on the argument that arming police is essential for maintaining law and order.

"Many university graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession. 
What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, 
should be done about it?","Nowadays we are facing the issue that a great total of graduates are completing their studies and becoming skilled but there are not many opportunities for them to get themselves involved in relevant jobs. This can be addressed by some important factors such as difficult environments and the poor infrastructure of industries. These can be solved by introducing some solutions like making the system more decorated and so on.

To begin with, one of the most deleterious factors is nepotism. We can see in most cases that recruitment has been taken by the control of the people who always try to select those candidates who are known to them, although it is required to choose  skilled  applicants. For instance, the managing director of a company has the power to impact the employee selection process so if he wants to keep that person who is very familiar to him then there should remain nothing to do with him. Another factor regarding this issue is that there could be less total of vacancies in the job market. Sometimes the balance between the total of grads and the required employee gets missing. For example, especially in under-developing countries, the control of the number of alumni versus post vacancies is very fickle. The university produces a greater number of graduates than the industries need. That causes highly skilled alumni to become unemployed.

So, the authorities have to take  responsibility to counter these issues. One solution could be for the appointing system must have to be non-partial and authentic so that only eligible ones could have the chance to get shortlisted. Suppose in the interview, the interviewer should check the actual ability of the candidate, not his family status. On top of that, the industries are needed to expand, which will cause a great number of job fields. The company may collaborate with the research departments of the universities which will help a lot in introducing new products or methods in their working fields. 

In conclusion, there are some pressing factors in the unemployment of  highly qualified graduates for example, partiality in the job opportunity or imperfect management of developing working areas. The government can obtain some solutions like making a fair interviewing panel or spreading out the job field in such a way that the grads get the capability to prove themselves.","### Task Achievement:

"In many places women are taking jobs, which are traditionally done by men. What do you think make these changes happen? What’s your opinion about it?","Nowadays, more and more women are working in plants, firms and industrial sites where only men  are used to be employed. Women are now more ambiguous and competing with men. This essay will explore reasons  why women are taking places occupied by men and at the end of the essay will underline my opinion.

Firstly, the reason is that there are so many single women pursuing their careers instead of building families. This could create competitive women who are eager for career development instead of building healthy relationships.For instance, compared to married women single one will wish for high-paid jobs and career opportunities because the only passion of not married women is their job opportunities.Thus that is why men are being replaced by females in job places.

Secondly, there are so many lonely mothers who give upbringing to their offspring. Consequently, they need more prospective job positions with high salaries since not everything is affordable nowadays because of high-cost products.For example , in order to afford a good education and food supply for their kids' parents should earn more money. Thus, women are taking any positions even men needed positions because it gives them the opportunity for earning high wages.

To conclude, it is true that women are taking men's traditional workplaces. In our contemporary community , the world it is common that women and men are on the same level. In my opinion, women should know their limitations and never compete with men because men are considered to be the chief of the family. Otherwise, females will stay lonely and not be respected by men.","**Task Achievement: [6]**

"In some countries, people encourage students to find part-time jobs while some people don't. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","In the contemporary epoch,there is irrefutable debate among folks  about part-time jobs for graduates.In certain countries,individuals inspire learners to find part-time employment while others do not advocate for it. I firmly coincide with and withstand the stated notion that it will expose the student in the line of the employment environment.This discourse will further elucidate my assertion in the forthcoming paragraph.

Firstly,this kind of exposure is very advantagious to the young stars although the society is not really for it.They end up practising what they are taught in lecture rooms as a results the gain experience and get exposure particularly in their area of interest.Moreover,work experience can help them land their dream job because most recruiters prefer to employ individuals with some experience.For example,a research done by kepsa(2020) depicts that 90% of employer prefer to give a job to people who have gone for an internship which help them as they do not take long to adapt to the system.Consequently,it is imperative for school-going people to undertake part-time attachment.

On the other hand,this can be detrimental since it can bring some disruption in the study although the student understands and retain more when they practice what they are taught in the classroom.Furthermore ,the scholar is not in a position to prepare for exams or even attend group discussion with others as there are duties allocated to them by the employer.For example,a research done by  the University of Nairobi depicts that part-time jobs for finalists make them drop out of school.Therefore,a certain individual does not advise pupils to work as it affects their performance as well as some end up dropping out of the academy

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.","From last two decades advancement in techonology grows drastically, that day is not far when its gonna replace humans everywhere. This improvement will introduce its own pros and cons that I will discuss in following paragraphs.

To begin with benefits, robots will be quicker because if same job is assigned to an indvidual and a machine it will be apparent second one will finish the wrok faster. for example,, to build a five stroy bulding genral labour will take atleast two years but when its replaced by robots it will be only the matter of few weeks.

Moving towards the drawbacks firstly, will cause unemployement when most taks will be completed by mechanical beings then folks will be jobless.

Secondloy it will produce unhealthy society because people will always relay on robots to do even basic things like, having a cup of water or swithing off lights from bed these will result to no physical avtivities and will make society lazy.

"In some countries, people encourage students to find part-time jobs while some people don't. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","It is often suggested that students should indulge in part-time internships while undergoing their studies. Some people, however, may argue and discourage students from doing so. I will discuss both  views in this essay but personally, I believe that youngsters must find part-time jobs which will help them in long term.

To begin with, those who do not favour students in applying for half-time placement states their reason that freshmen should concentrate on their studies and complete their degree with distinction. They think that getting involved in work at this stage will create unnecessary extra pressure that will lead to low grades in college or university. Moreover, they think that this time can be utilized more on exam preparations required for higher studies. For example, undergraduates in their final year usually do not opt for any internships and exploit their time in preparing for MBA and master’s exams. Hence, for these reasons, some individuals do not encourage pupils to work.

On the other hand, part-time jobs offer lots of advantages to younglings. Firstly, they can apply their theoretical knowledge and gain immense experience through these temporary placements. And secondly, the work experience gained can help them land  their dream jobs as most recruiters prefer people having some experience. For example, many engineering colleges in India have made it compulsory for their students to undergo two months of internship which benefits them in achieving their dream career. Therefore, it is advised to undertake a part-time profession for the above-mentioned motives.

In conclusion, I agree that students must take on part-time jobs to ensure that they gain relevant experience which will give them an enormous advantage in developing their careers.","## Task Achievement:

Indeed, it might a trend in the contemporary day; however, I believe that some jobs are still requested for real people.  This essay will discuss compelling examples to sustain my belief. 

There is no doubt that Ai can do numerous works. Because of deep learning and AI algorithms, computer and robots can apply repetitive and simple work, such as manufacturing and accounting. Take factories for example. Through precision computer science, AI might improve effectiveness, accuracy, and productivity compared with what traditional laborers did in the manufactory. Also, AI workers will work for their employers without asking for rest. It is significant to accelerate the productivity and the quality of production. 

On the other hand, AI might not take over some intricate jobs which are required for human judgment and experience.  For example, some medical procedures should be operated by skilled surgeons. It is because complex surgeries are crucial and are related to legal issues. Thus, human surgeons should take responsibility for medical decisions instead of AI robots.  Although there are increasing numbers of driverless cars on roads, the autopilot system is reported with an unexpected gap in the reality and causes several fatal car accidents worldwide. Thus, AI-driven vehicles cannot fully substitute for drivers in the short-term time.

In conclusion, even if it is convenient to utilize AI to enhance the efficiency of the job market, I believe that it cannot fully dominate employment and take the place of humans in all aspects of fields.","### Task Achievement:

"Experts believe that over the next decade, robots will be doing many of the jobs currently done by humans. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.","Nobody is a stranger to the fact that we live in a digital world. Many experts contend that over the next 10 years, robots will take over the jobs in many industries, which are currently done by people. To my way of thinking, there are both pros and cons to this proposal in equal measure. 

There are many advantages, if you ask me, to this situation. In the first place, it increases work productivity at the workplace. Machines can work much longer hours than human employees without taking breaks. Their result is much more efficient and far more accurate than employees. People may make mistakes at work, but machines do not. Added to this, they do not have to be paid. Some occasional repairs are may be required over the long periods.  This saves a great amount of money for businesses. For instance, many supermarkets in many countries use automatic customer check-out points, which avoid hiring many workers. 

Be that as it may, the downsides of this phenomenon, if you ask me, are just as big. For one thing, it raises the unemployment rate. People who lose jobs because of this will have no income and therefore no money to spend. This could cause serious consequences for the economy. To name but one example, governments cannot get taxes from individuals. As a result of this, governments do not have enough funds for schools, hospitals, public transport and many other facilities and infrastructure. It follows to stand, therefore, that the quality of all essential services will suffer. 

Turning to my own experience, the way things are when it comes to this issue in my country, China, is the same as it was across the world over. My home city of Shanghai is a classic case in point. Here, many factories use robots to make products. Many workers cannot find jobs due to the higher preferences for machines in industrial sectors. 

At the end of the day, there are merits and drawbacks to all choices we make in life. It is very important that governments play a role in creating enough employment opportunities for humans. This will develop their societies in a much more sustainable way.","## Task Achievement:

"Nowadays, more and more jobs and tasks which involve hard physical work are done by machines. Do the positive effects of this trend outweigh the negative effects?","It is increasingly common that smart machines have been applied in some situations in which normal workers can not touch or accomplish. Therefore, I totally tend to agree such a phenomenon is productive for most labourers, corporations, and countries. 

Admittedly, utilizing machines may result in some workers losing their jobs, especially those who are semi-literates or illiterates in a short period. While the governments can take various measures –training classes, declining taxes, and so on- to diminish this situation.

In terms of individuals, without hard work conditions, it means that they are under good protection and lower threats from uncontrolled weather or disasters. Compared with the last century, miners need to dig raw materials (such as coal, gold, iron, etc. ) via hammers and shovels  in the underground, which means they are not only in high-intensity work but also at threat of toxic gas; while today, so many robots and artificial machines are utilized in such dangerous field which dramatically reduces the chance that workers be hurt. In addition, as a company leader, what makes he/she most concerned is investments and profits. It is undeniable that machines can promote efficiency and enduring working during the same workload and limited time; when compared to hundreds of labourers. That is why a number of corporate leaders are fonder of taking revolutions in old product lines with new and reliable technologies. More importantly, applying machines in different fields is a symbol of a modern country, which means a good deal of talented people and perfect industry systems are already paying off.

To sum up, artificial machines allow people to get rid of hard work. although utilizing these smart apparatuses may have negative effects on a part group, it can reduce the rate of safety and develop good outcomes in the long term.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificial robots. What is your opinion?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant example from your knowledge or experience. Write at least 250 words.","Nowadays, some people assume that occupations might be substituted progressively by artificial robots in the future. In my opinion, although a majority of simple jobs will be done by robots ultimately, it is impossible that positions which require human relations can be replaced. This essay will discuss the reasons why only particular jobs will be finally taken over.

Without a doubt, artificial robots will easily overtake the jobs that do not require specific and complex human skills in the workforce. From a cost point of view, many companies will choose to use artificial intelligence because it is far less expensive than training and employing a human. Cashiers in supermarket, for instance, are gradually being replaced by checkout machines that cost far less than employees. Customers can easily pay for their goods by using self-checkout facilities rather than standing in a long queue to wait for services at a counter. For these reasons, using artificial robots can be a significantly effective way for companies. 

Conversely, there are some complicated human jobs that will never be overtaken by robotic intelligence because robots do not have the capacities to achieve. In other words, some particular occupations require complex and critical thinking that only human brain can do. For example, science-related jobs, such as doctors, scientists, pharmacists, engineers, can only be carried out by the professionals, even in the future. Robots will not be able to sort out all of the problems which need to be overcome by human. 

In conclusion, with the development of advanced technology, it is no doubt that robots have the abilities to replace a significant number of occupations in the near future. Unskilled labour will eventually be done by machines entirely; however, some sophisticated fields that require specific and complicated human skills will always exist. Consequently, occupations in particular professional areas will be safe in an increasingly artificial intelligent world.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"In the future, artificially intelligent robots will do all jobs, replacing humans in the workforce. While it is possible that robots will eventually do all exactly repetitive jobs, it is unlikely that jobs that require empathy skills by humans will be taken over. This essay will discuss why people, not replaced by robots, will carry out only some specific jobs.

Robots may do jobs with repetitive and straightforward steps that do not require specific and complex human skills. Many companies have applied artificial intelligence robots into programmable tasks to improve processes instead of hiring and training their employees. In many manufacturing factories, for example, many routine production steps have been replaced by automated solutions run by robots that cost far less than employees. In addition, the automated stations work around the clock and require no holiday or sick leave like the workforce. For these reasons, some suitable jobs that can be suitable by robotic process automation will be replaced.

On the contrary, some human jobs cannot be replaced by robots because artificial robots will never reach the efficient capacity to do them. The jobs that need psychology, education, medical, and social work require human empathy. In undeveloped countries, for instance, uneducated people need social workers to help them relieve their minds. Additionally, when people face fatal health problems, such as cancer, doctors gradually attempt to empathise, parallel with a situation assessment, to their relatives or even directly to patients. Therefore, it is too complicated that robots will be programmed to well complete those jobs instead of humans being.

In conclusion, it is increasingly possible that robots will be gradually replaced most human tasks soon. Robots may entirely complete the unskilled jobs; however, not all jobs are replaced by automated solutions, sophisticated jobs that still need empathy from humans will always exist. Ultimately, the complicated jobs that are required a high-skilled workforce are still safe parallel in the automated solution environment increasing.","## Task Achievement:

In some countries people encourage teenagers to find part time jobs. Some people agree and others don't.

While some people believe that this trend should not be followed, others argue that it helps to build strong minded teenagers. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and explain my support for the latter view.

One of the most important drawback of teenagers involved in part time jobs is time management. The younsters who work in any part time job are mostly undergarduate students or higher secondary students, because of their part time jobs they get very less time for their studies which in turn leads to bad scores in their marksheets.  Additionally, some part time jobs includes morning and late night shifts, which is the most important time for good sleep. As a reult it directly effects the productivity of the teenagers.

However, part time jobs gives the opportunity to experience real time world apart from studies and college life. Working experience gives the chance to learn from your own mistakes from a very young age, that hepls to build the stronger future. For example, there are some students who does not have any financial support for their education, they  can earn their living and fulfill their dreams, and achieve their goals by their own.

"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. 
What is your opinion?","Some may argue that in the future all human workforces will be replaced by robots. While it is possible that most low skill jobs will be taken over by artificial intelligent computers, it is still difficult for some area of work to fully rely on them. This essay will discuss why in the end humans are still needed to do many other jobs.

First, the majority of the non-complex occupation will be handle by robot in the future. It simply because, robot can be easily programmed to do a constant and simple job, moreover, companies will try their best to limit the salary expense by hiring more robots to replace the non-essential workforce. In Indonesia for example, they already started to create an automatic payment gate in every toll-roads. In addition, this automatic gate now being implemented and more common to be found as an exit gate in the parking area. For these reasons, ,eventually many low-level jobs will be replaced by robot in the future.

On the other hand, there are a lot of specific jobs that utterly cannot be substituted by another thing but human.  This condition applies because that kind of work often needs the intervere of the human brain as decision-makers. Doctors for instance, need to analyse many aspects of patients before taking actions and receipt of proper medicines. That kind of complex decision-making process is very unique and robot will not be able to compete with humans.

"It is generally observed that almost all high level jobs are done by men.Does it mean that the government should encourage a certain percentage of these jobs to be observed for women?
Do you agree or disagree with this proposition?","Nowadays, a great deal of attention has been paid to gender equality. Some people insist that government should quote the percentage of men and women who engage in managing jobs. I strongly agree with the idea because gender inequality is a severe problem in this contemporary world, and it is difficult to solve this without support from the government.

To begin with, the first reason why I support this is that there is a huge gap between males and females at workplaces. In fact, men more likely to be promoted than women in Japan. Japan is ranked 121st out of 150 countries regarding Gender Gap Index in 2020, and there are 10 per cent of female who play important role at office. This is because men have been jacked up the scores for a long time, and this is not because women inferior to man.

Another reason why I believe the government have better observe high-level positions for females is that society needs legal force. In general, managing positions are dominated by men in Japan. As a result, women struggle to be promoted and become executives. Traditionally, seniors do not think women become a member of society, since it had been considered that the greatest success as a woman is to become a housewife and raise children. Hence, it is easier to direct gender equality for companies when the government set a rule.

"Some people believe  that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent  robots?

What is your opinion?","It's argued that  with today's advanced automation, robots will replace humans in all jobs in the coming days. I strongly disagree that there are many jobs that cannot be substituted by automation despite  the advancement in  technology. This essay will elaborate on few real-time cases.

  Firstly, not all task can be replaced. For instance, Labour delivery in hospitals must and should be done by doctors, because of complications at times, that need to implement on the spot which only comes with experience. However, robots with programme implanted might not be the better option. Secondly, not only this, we have few more cases where mechanisation fail if replaced. Let's take the pilot, Also like the above case, we need to act on real-time circumstances such as weather, turbulence etc., where human pilots have no replacement. Therefore, I strongly oppose the opinion that all jobs will be replaced by artificial intelligence.

For example, in an Insecurity stream such as bomb dismantles we can save lives if we can use automated gadgets such as drones and robots. In future we can see way more robots in the military, replacing humans. Other than  few tasks, artificial intelligence cannot replace the individual.

  In conclusion, Eventhough, some argue that jobs will be replaced by automation, I strongly believe that a lot of jobs may not be substituted by any technology in the coming future. However, few works can be and should be replaced for human safety as discussed.","## Task Achievement:

"Only 20% of Tech Jobs are Held by Women.
What problems do women face that prevent them from getting these jobs and what must be done to change this situation?","Men have dominated job sector since the industry revolution, despite progress in gender equality. Men still seem to outnumber the women in terms of employment in tech business. In this essay I shall discuss the issues tossed against women in securing these jobs and changes that need to be put forth to reduce this inequality. 

Regardless of having equal or superior skills to their male counterpart, women often feel societal pressure and cultural norms work against them while seeking jobs. Interviewers question the female applicants about their martial and parental status to understand their personal commitments before offering them the job, hence women are pushed to carefully guard their details in an interview, so they don’t lose out on the job. Additionally, not having a collage degree or computer science graduation tend to lower their confidence at workplace or when applying for jobs, because in many cultures’ families encourage men to pursue higher education while women are pushed performed household activities. For instances in Asian countries people believe that men are bread winners of the family as well as invest in their education but on the other hand women are taught to take care of the home and perform domestic work. All these factors make the career path of a woman more challenging.

Many women activist across the globe have brought up this issue to the society and fought gender equality in job market. As result of this, today many corporate companies incorporated polices to ensure their work force have equal number of women and men employee. Other than this IT sector need diligently transform their corporate culture to respect all employees, moreover make discrimination and gender inequality socially unacceptable. These changes will make the womenfolk feel more secure and boost their morality, thus we can perhaps close the gap between gender disparity.

To conclude, cultural norms need to change in employment and educational settings to permanently eliminate the problem of gender discrimination, so every woman can feel confident, supported and safe as they pursue their dreams.","## Task Achievement:

Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.,"Artificially intelligent robots are progressively replacing humans in the workforce. While it is possible that all menial jobs will eventually done by robots, it is unlikely that jobs that require human contact will be taken over. This essay will discuss why eventually only very few jobs will be carried out by people.

Robots may eventually replace all human labour that does not require specific and complex human skills. Many companies will turn to artificial intelligence because it is far less expensive than hiring, training and employing a human. In supermarkets in Australia, for example, many cashiers have been replaced by automated stations that cost far less than employees. In addition, these automated stations work around the clock and require no holidays or holiday pay. For these reasons, jobs that can be replaced by robotic intelligence will be replaced.

Conversely, there are some human jobs that cannot be replaced because robots will never achieve the capacity to do them. Put simply, some jobs require a 'human touch'. These jobs include psychology, education, medicine and social work to name but a few. Robots will never be able to achieve what has taken social evolution hundreds of thousands of years to achieve.

It is increasingly likely that robots will end most human employment. Unskilled labour will eventually be done entirely by robots; however sophisticated jobs that require human specific skills will always exist. Ultimately, few jobs will be safe in an increasingly artificial intelligent workforce.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots, what is your opinion?","At present time, there have been many intelligent robots that can be able to work as same as humans do. Although, some might say that people are into and can be more practical, some argue that a smart invention is totally accurate. I strongly believe that we should intrigate between humankind and robots because both of them have its pros and cons. This essay will explore the benefits and some drawbacks in following paragraphs.

As nowadays there are a number of artificial intelligent robots involve in many industries for a few advantages. One of these is they provide more accurate and precise processing than human. For example, there is a medical robotic machine which helps pharmacist to prepare the tablets for their patients and the medical errors are rarely found  when compared to providing medicine without helping of intelligent machanical inventions.

In contrast, a person can do some task better than a robotic invention, such as cooking in the high class restaurant as the fantastic meals need to be done by a sophisticated chief who can put and test the best ingradient in a hot pot for their customers. Nevertheless, a worker need to get paid for their insurance and other welfares while a robot does not need anythings like humans do.

To conclude, there are advantages and disadvantages both of these of them. A company should wisely make a dicision before choosing and consider which one is more worth or they can apply both of them in order to make more profits. Moreover, the most crucial is they can afford it. I believe that the organizations could earn more income if they opt a smart option.","### Task Achievement

Surveys show that many people believe most jobs in the future will be done at home.Do you agree or disagree ?,"Now a days many surveys depicts that “work from home” is the upcoming future trend. This essay completely agrees with the statement because this will save quite an amount of resources for the companies and moreover, it is comfortable for the employees.
To begin with, many companies will allow their employees to work from home. In almost all multinational companies, majority of work is done on the computers online contrary to the work done in the past which was done manually. Work like attending meeting, presentations and conversation with the clients can be easily done with the help of internet and it is not mandatory to go to the office. This saves huge amount of money with regards to paying rents, electricity bill and other running cost. A study performed on America’s largest company has proven that there is no significance difference between the efficacy from working in the office and from home along with positive impact on company’s balance sheet.
Secondly, it is very convenient for the employees to works from home. Going to the office and travelling long distance drains lot of energy and is very tiring and this negatively affect the overall performance. This can be negated by staying home and working in homely and comfortable environment. Several researches have shown that employees who are working from home have fewer health problems and less family issues as compared to the regular employees.

"Men and women are different in terms of their characteristics and abilities. For this reason, some jobs are better done by men and others by women.
Do you agree or disagree?","These days, it seems that more women are entering “male occupations” than ever before and vice versa. While some still hold to the conservative view that certain jobs are better performed by men and others by women, it is my personal belief that people of their sex are capable of doing any job effectively. The reasons for my position are as follows.

First of all, I believe it is a mistake to base our views on broad generalisations about the characteristics of men and women as such stereotypes are often inaccurate. Although there are certainly traits which are typical of men and others which are typical of women, there are exceptions to every rule. Not all women are physically weak, just as not all men are poor interpersonal communicators; conventional gender roles are not appropriate for everybody. If a man and woman desires to pursue a career which is traditionally reserved for the opposite sex, I believe he/ she should be provided the opportunity to prove him/ herself capable.

Secondly, I would contend that the presence of both males and females in a workplace brings a sense of balance. Men and women frequently, though by no means always, have different methods of doing things. Rather than judging these differences to be weakness, I feel that we should view them as opportunities for innovation and the discovery of more effective and efficient work practices. A person’s weakness can thus be transformed into strengths.

In summary, I once again reaffirm my position that both male and female employees are an asset to any industry and as our stereotypes about men and women are not always appropriate, we must not discourage anyone from choosing an occupation simply because of his/ her gender.","## Task Achievement:

"Many university graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession. What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, should be done about it?","When young people are choosing what subject to study at university, most of them hope they will find a great job upon graduation. In reality many fresh graduates fail to find work in their field and some are even forced to take up a below graduate level job. In my opinion, the root of this problem lies in the outdated higher education system that should be modernized.
Traditional university education does not prepare students for their first job for a number of reasons. One of them is that many programmes are too theoretical. It means that highly educated graduates lack simple skills required for employment, for example, the knowledge of IT software. Employers, therefore, prefer candidates with hands-on experience. Another reason is that universities offer too many courses in popular fields, such as business and law, and do not recruit enough students for engineering and science programmes. As a result, the UK labour market has an oversupply of law graduates and a deficit of engineers. 
A reform of higher education could alleviate many of the problems but would require joint efforts from universities and the government. If universities worked closer with employers, they could teach students practical skills that companies look for. Meanwhile, the government could develop guidelines on how many students universities should recruit in each subject in accordance with the market demand.
In conclusion, a likely reason why many graduates cannot find a job in their field is because university education might not have provided them with the right skill set or an in-demand profession. I think that universities and the government could improve the situation by updating the content of the programmes and limiting the number of students in each subject in line with the market demand.","**Task Achievement: [5.5]**

Whether or not someone achieve their aims is mostly by a question of luck. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people claim that luck is the most crucial element contributing to a person's success. While I accept that luck does have an important role in helping people reach their targets, I would argue that hard work and determination are much more crucial factors leading to the achievement of an individual. 

On the one hand, I agree that luck can be an important factor. First, some people are fortunate enough to be born in a wealthy family, which allows them to have a better education or to easily start their own business without having to borrow money from someone else. As a result, these people tend to have better opportunities to succeed than those coming from poor families. Furthermore, some individuals are lucky to be given great talents which others do not have. For example, Mozart was able to play music when he was very young, or Lionel Messi already had great football skills when he was born. 

However, I would argue that although luck can be necessary, it is not the most crucial factor leading to success. Firstly, people need to work really hard and put much effort into their jobs if they want to be successful. For instance, before becoming one of the best football players in the world, Cristiano Ronaldo had to go through intense training hours every day for many years. Secondly, a person is less likely to reach his targets if he does not have determination. On the way leading to success, there might be many difficulties, and people need to keep moving forward to overcome those challenges. 

In conclusion, while I agree that luck is important to some extent in helping people become successful, I believe that hard work and determination are the most important elements.","**Task Achievement:** 8.5

"Some people say in order to prevent illness and disease, governments should focus on reducing environmental pollution and housing problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is argued that governments should prioritize addressing environmental pollution and housing issues as a means to prevent health-related problems. From my perspective, I largely agree with this statement.

On the one hand, there are several methods to deter illness and disease that the government can invest in. Biological research or clinical study could be taken as prominent examples. These studies potentially lead to a better understanding, or better yet, new knowledge about different aspects of health issues, thereby preventing illness and eliminating the roots of it efficiently. However, these research plans may incur substantial costs due to the need for numerous facilities. Consequently, governments might expend on these domains but do not necessarily focus on them.

On the other hand, an investment in reducing environmental problems and house-related ones are seemingly more effective than the aforementioned. First and foremost, people are exposed to the surrounding environment, including both public areas and houses, on a daily basis. hence, if there are some evironment issues such as air pollution or water pollution, their health is immediately impacted profoundly; and because of this, when such problems are addressed, the benefits will quickly come as a result. For instance, when air pollution in Hanoi is reduced due to municipal initiatives, reports indicate a decrease in the number of respiratory-related patients. Ultimately, it is more urgent to tackle issues related to the environment and housing.

In conclusion, while there may be other remedies to prevent ailments and diseases such as scientific research, I advocate that emphasis on reducing environmental and housing problems is of paramount significance.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people think that governments should focus on reducing environmental pollution and housing problems to help people prevent illness and disease.

I strongly believe that government officials must putting their energy on tackling the toxicity on the air and households need because of two reasons which are locally and internationally.

The main reason why I believe that government have to solve the problem of toxicity in the air and their citizen’s housing is because they have a local duties toward citizen which means that themselves are obliged to offers these needs. Furthermore, countries should have go after citizen needs and one of the fundamental needs are to live in area where the air is clean and to have a place to sleep. Despite the fact, that government’s officials are citizen at the end.

Another reason why I think that countries need to solve any problem related to environment and household so because they have an international duties toward their citizens. Obviously, most of the countries are in the United Nations and to be member countries have to agree to the United Nation’s rule. In fact, most of the rules are talking about what are the human needs such – housing, jutice, safety, and health -; therefore, all countries must offer these needs to their citizen.

I think people do that because they have the cognitive to protect the historical value of the buildings and the sense of connection that people felt within the exploration. In order to research their history, people can gather the knowledge and memories that elder citizens around them have and go to the libraries in their cities.

Many buildings with great historical value had been destroyed because of the wars and people's ignorance in the past. Therefore, many people appeal for the protection of buildings. After people have the cognitive to appreciate the  beauty of historical buildings, people willing to find out the history of the buildings in their own living places.

Because the forms of architecture are special due to the unique elements a location has, such as weather and culture, these link everyone who lives there and make them feel united.

how can people research this ?","These days, humans try to give meaning to their lives and they have approached  this point in distinguished ways, one of them is looking forward to the history of their house. In some regions, the people's tendency to figure out the history of their residence shows a significant growth. It may caused by some reasons which I tend to elaborate on.

Initially, they claim that the dichotomy of the good or evil personality of previous owners will be absolutely effective in their current life. For instance, the location where a murder occurred is not a wise choice to reside. On the contrary, a place where a well-known person has lived, can be appropriate for settling down. In my opinion, these sorts of beliefs are conveyed by cinemas and Hollywood by producing films with these kinds of concepts.

Moreover, others see this situation as an opportunity for profitable investment. For example, the person who purchased one of England's royal families' palaces, emphasising the past incidents of that property can assist the investor to raise the value of that place. They have admitted that the history of those particular regions is the best advertisement and promotion to achieve more by selling at a higher price or renting to special tenants in exchange for worthable prices. In my view, this kind of notion could be beneficial for both conserving besides, understanding the value of there among the locals.

In the case of how the citizens can search about these matters, I would say with a couple of simple ways. First question the neighbours about the points that are important to you. Furthermore, through the fast progress of technology, you can use the internet to find out. If the society where you decide to buy a home is not extensive, you can carry out some research in the domestic library. Actually, I prefer to use the Internet in advance.

-How can people research this?","Nowadays, we can find growing number of people who are inclined to find out histories of their accommodations in some countries. It would be interesting and productive to figure out the reasons for this surging interest, and the way to research this. 

In terms of reasons for this, I believe there are economic and educational reasons. First and foremost, the financial motivation is the biggest and outstanding. In some countries, there are many antique cities containing ancient building built in middle age. If the old building has special history and the owner could reveal it, he could earn a myriad of money. For example, if the accommodation I live was once an office of Adam Smith, the father of modern economic theory, the value of building will certainly upsurge. Secondly, investigating the history of their own house would be good research topic for children. By studying the history and collecting anecdotes of building, children can easily learn the history of their family, hometown. It could be challenging but also riveting project. In this way, history education would be much friendly to many children. 

For researching the history of buildings, I can suggest three methods. First of all, meticulous research of old writings, including history books, novels, biographies are important. We can find some hints from those literature. And in terms of reliability, historical writing is most credible source. In addition, anecdotal approach will be also useful.

Some of the buildings might keep precious memories or simply they want to know the conditions of their houses. This essay not only elaborates the explanation of this phenomenon  but also provides suggestions about the resources.  

The main reason for this is for administration purposes. The majority of individuals who want to sell their houses ought to have enough data about their buildings' conditions. These can include how long they have been built, the quality of it, and others. In addition, not only for administration purposes  but also several of the houses are heritage from our ancestors. Obviously, it will be very interesting if we study about where we come from. For example,  old house were already placed by one big family inheritance so it kept historical moments from time to time. Therefore, community is always excited when they know the fact that the places they live in built a hundred years ago. 

Although it seems hard to find the pieces of information about these monuments, we can do some research by looking at personal possessions and inventories. Parents indeed have enough data and documents about them and we can link it with photos that our ancestors left.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","Nowadays, society in certain nations is growing interest in exploring the past story of the places they inhabit. Personally, I believe that the inhabitants who are concerned about the comfort of living in their places will be intrigued to learn their living places' history. Moreover, this process can be done by uncovering interesting stories and hidden details of the area. 

First of all, one of the most common reasons to find out the backstory of a place is backed by the urge to connect with their living spaces in order to live comfortably. For instance, there is a specific neighbourhood in South Tangerang in which the houses' walls are often soaked by water every rainy season. After the house owners established a further investigation, it was revealed that the whole cluster was built above an area that used to be a swamp. In this case, people found answers to their setbacks by learning about the historical aspects of their habitats.

In addition, the research process of discovering the history of the buildings can be achieved by finding out about captivating trivia and unseen parts of the place. Using the same setting as the previous example, people in that area who struggled with leaked walls when the rain poured unveiled the truth by noticing that the GPS pointed to a watery area when they input their addresses. This group then asked experts in geography about the origin of their land and confirmed the facts to local governments. 

To sum up, the rationale for the people who become interested in exploring the history of their home is the curiosity to learn about the past in order to answer today's problems within the houses. Additionally, people can research this by looking at the small and rather implicit details of the neighbourhood.","**Task Achievement:**

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","In some nations, people are starting to be fascinated about getting to know more about what happened to their accommodations a long time ago. This is because the history of some buildings and houses could be very valuable, especially those that have stayed for thousands of years and a few ways to work out this are to ask grandparents and other elderly in the house and to look at the construction of the building.

One reason why the history of a house or building is appealing to householders is that ancient houses could be very valuable due to their special ways of being constructed. This is either because of the war or the common features of a house at that time and they are greatly invaluable since there is no such thing nowadays. For example, there is a house that stayed since the colony of French from two centuries ago until now in Quang Ninh district in Vietnam. The house was owned by an old man for a long period and when he died, it was preserved by the government because there were secret tunnels everywhere in the house and these were the evidence for how people survived  falling bombs in the war.

There are many ways to discover the history of the place where we are living and the most convenient one is to ask our grandparents and other older people who have lived there for ages. Grandparents are those who very respect history and they might live in the war period so by putting questions, they will be very willing to tell us not only their past but also the past of the house, in what condition it was constructed and why it was built there. Additionally, people can also look for the answer to this question by taking a look at the construction of the house. Places that have been built for a long time will have different ways of being constructed due to the technique and knowledge of people at that period of  history. For instance, in Hoian City, houses with red roofs and walls with special materials are abundant in virtue of the fact that this is an ancient city in Vietnam and this is also the preservation of the buildings in the Nguyen dynasty.

In conclusion, people are eager to know more about the history of their accommodations  because houses with a long past could be very highly valued in the way how they were constructed since they were one of the most crucial pieces of evidence in the development of human beings. To research more about this, people can come to their ancestors for more specific information and try to discover the difference between the construction of our house and other ones is also a useful way as well.","## Task Achievement:

This can be out of some curiosity or just for fun to share with their family. However, it can be needed for more practical reasons such as interior or reconstruction.

Some people may be simply curious about who previously had lived in their house and whether any special or unusual events had happened there. These stories can be either a good-luck sign or a cautious point for them if there had been some successful or dangerous stories and give them a wider perspective where they dwell.

Others, on the other hand, may wonder about the specific information for their certain purposes. They may be willing to rebuild the house or make a big interior change of it. For those reasons, some researches about the house like the date of construction, structure and materials used are needed in advance. Since learning about the accurate information and history is sometimes crucial for the conservation or reconstruction.  

To collect such information of a house or a building, there are various ways available. The easiest way is to ask your real estate agency of previous owners of the house.

The leading cause of this phenomenon is the feeling of belonging to the place where they live, and In my opinion, the best way for them to learn more about it is through the Internet. In this essay, I shall delve into the list above and provide some evidence to support my statements.

I believe that the significant reason that dwellers discover their home history is based on the connection to their living surroundings. This situation can be especially relevant for those who have lived in their neighbourhood for decades and even inherited it from their family members. Historical research can help homeowners learn more about the person who loved deeply and lived there. To illustrate it, a study in France taken by residents who had researched the past events of their abode exposed that over 88% had done it based on the attachment to their living spaces.

There are considerable ways for individuals to investigate and understand more about their home, but the internet is the best and most efficient method to start the exploration. Search engines such as Bing and Google provide numerous resources and websites for citizens to learn. Searching online can reduce the time spent on finding information, as most of the data has already been collected, and it is possible to manage multifarious resources, including building permits and the old house photograph. For instance, using digital tools such as Yahoo can decrease time by at least 50% for organising and researching data.

In my point of view, in recent years, every people have their own buildings to live in. They tend to search about the past of their building because of a high curiosity. A high curiosity leads them to ask many things about the building such as how many times the building is being renovated and the people who live in it before. Moreover, the community have a strong principle that is unknown, and unloved, which means that if they know better, they will treat their house or building well. To illustrate, the community that lives in a building must know where the areas in their property which are damaged and leaked. This is very important to define what kind of maintenance or treatment to their property.

Furthermore, to know about history deeply they have to find the correct information. First, they can find it from the owner before. By asking the story about their building to the owner before, they will know deeper. Second, they can ask their recent neighbours that live close to their house or building. The neighbour must know about the story of the building which is close to their living place. For example, when people buy a second house, it will be better to know the past by asking the neighbours who are living close to the property.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?","Presently, people who live in some nations have a tendency to observe the narrative of their house or accommodation. This article will elaborate on the reasons for this trend and the best approach to do research on this issue.

To begin with, the main reasons why some are curious about the story of their accommodation are for  economic purposes and to understand their ancestors for their identity matters. For the first reason, it is clear that individuals who have old buildings which contain historical values will benefit  financially. This means that they can sell their belonging to collectors or simply build them as historical sites and promotes them to attract visitors. Another reason is  to understand their founding fathers. By knowing it, people may build a sense of identity ,particularly  individuals who live in multicultural cities such as London and New York. Moreover, they can give this valuable information to their children that their cultural backgrounds even races are rooted in Africa or Asian regions such as China and Southeast Asian countries. 

In order to reach reliable information about the historical aspect of their residence, one of the best methods is an interview. In means that they can acquire data from neighbours who may live for a long time in the area where they live in. For instance, they can prepare a questionnaire for elderly citizens who know well about the story behind the residence in its surrounding. In addition, they can add  gathering data from local history museums or from  old documents that are usually located in local or even national libraries. Therefore, by doing this research they can collect  trustworthy data from reliable sources.

In conclusion, understanding the house's narrative has a significant role in their life.

what are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?","The number of people who are interested in knowing the history of their accommodation has been increasing in some countries. What is the root cause of this curiosity and what can people do to solve this complicated question? It is clear we can trace the reason back to TV programs broadcasting many historical buildings in which people live, and we must do everything we can to handle the situation: namely by adopting an individual and group approach to comprehend the history.

First of all, we must recognize many TV programs all around the world broadcast  topics which are related to history. These can include the history of people's accommodation. By way of an example, some TV companies collaborate with university professors in order to figure out the background of buildings in both cities and suburbs. According to the article in the Asahi Shimbun newspaper published last month, eight out of ten Japanese adults answered they got interested in the history of their properties because of the above-mentioned programs. Therefore, more and more people are becoming interested in the history.

In order to research the history of people's properties, people should engage in an individual and group approach to figure out it. As an individual way, people could use academic or historical articles to find out the information related to their accommodation. Actually, this movement is already occurring in some countries in East Asia with great success. In terms of a group approach, people should request their government to reveal the history. If many people could submit letters of appeal to their government, the information will be provided. As a consequence of these measures, people will know the history of their accommodation.

what are the reasons for this? 
how can people research this ?","Nowadays, people become highly interested in the history of their houses or the building they live in. This will discuss the reason for this trend and how people search for that information.

To begin, people want to search about their property's history because they are trying to add more value to it. Finding interesting information will give their home more emotional value on top of its original value. For instance, houses that belong to a famous singer or actor are sold for a higher price than other normal houses. Because people think the emotional value of those houses will remain constant and may even increase in the future. As a result, if they ever decide to sell the house, the buyer will pay a higher price because of its history.

They can research this historical information either by asking their neighbours or by searching the internet. Many find those two ways the fastest ways to find answers to their questions about the history of their houses. They can ask their neighbour about the history and if there is anyone who knows the true value of the area around him, or they can take some pictures and post them on the internet and wait for some experts to answer their questions. For example, before we bought our house two years ago, I asked the neighbour, who lived by the house, if there was something special about it, and they showed me a history book that contained all the historical events and people who had lived there.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.
What are the reasons for this? 
How can people research this?","The history of a house or a building can be fascinating, sometimes daunting or even mesmerising at times if we try to delve into it. For some people, learning about the history of the houses, in which they live, is utterly important for various reasons. This essay attempts to outline some of those possible reasons for this and a couple of methods to research this.

The first possible reason for many to become inquisitive about the past of their houses could be that they actually want to find a connection, if any, between themselves and the buildings. Such connections, or lack thereof, could actually provide an insight to them as to whether those buildings contained anything “unique” at some stages of their existence that would make them- the people that is – feel “special” among the others, or “different” from the rest of the crowds in their neighbourhoods. After all, I think that it feels really good to remain at the centre of attention every now and then.

Some people would be interested to learn about the history of their buildings, especially how they were built, or what kinds of materials were used to construct them because they want to make sure that the buildings are safe enough for living. After all, nobody would want to put their lives at risk by choosing to live in a “weak” building that was built with some “unreliable” materials about a century ago!

There are many reasons for this trend of behavior, and also a variety of ways to conduct an effective research in order to fulfill this desire.
The most obvious reason behind the will of investigating one's house's past is the raised awareness of people about history. The pedestrians now understand that knowing what had happened before they moved there is a way to show respect to previous holders of the house, as well as the community they are living in. Furthermore, having knowledge about the accommodation and its neighborhood will make it easier for the newcomers to get acquainted to people around there. For example, when one man get to know that his house has been preserved as a historical heritage, he would treat it more responsibly and have a better attitude with his neighbors, who might also care about his house.
Because of this change in mindset of the new citizens, public also provides a wide range of methods for those who want to have researches about their house's history. One of the ways is by books in local libraries and tours to different places in the area, conducted by the authority and guided by people who have been living there for a long time. However, in my opinion, the most effective way to gain more understandings about one's house is by asking the pedestrians in that area about what he is curious about. The information from these residents is more accurate and lively than reports published, which may have been modified in order to be appropriate to a variety of kinds of reader.

I believe there are several main causes are affected people to discover the history of their place of living. Firstly, the inspiration of culture and tradition have a major influence on this. The majority of the society believes that living in a place with a historical value provides them honourable lives within the community. The next reason is real interest in the history and architectural designs of the buildings. This leads people to find more about the older building designs while understanding their lifestyles, and how the older generations made their lives comfortable within the same building. For instance, one person in my village found his house was an older England residence and the cooling system which they used was incredible. 

Nowadays, people have a number of options to dig that history. The easiest method is referred historical books about the area, which they can easily find from the regional public library and museum.

"In some countries, more and more people becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. What are reasons for this?

Below I will give some information about the main roots and the Possible ways to access this kind of data.

About the main roots & people's interest about the history of their houses, there are obvious points to say.

"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in. 
What are the reasons for this?
How can people research this?","Real estate buyers are becoming more interested in past information of the building they are buying, which is a common trend around the world. It seems to me that there are two main reasons, including safety concern and psychological belief and several ways to investigate the history of a house.

Firstly, researching a home`s past allows people to make sure about its architectural history for preservation purposes. For example, it is essential to know when it was built, what it is built of, what changes had been made, or how it was used before. This detailed information can help meet the security requirements of the owners so that they can know exactly what changes and repairs need to be made. Secondly, understanding the history of the house in which you live is one of the reasons to live happily. No one wants to live in a house where some dreadful events had happened, such as murder or violence.  

Tracing the history of old houses could be more challenging than contemporary houses. However there can be several ways to explore the history. First, using internet seems possible to compile initial facts since a wide range of records are becoming more available online today. Official websites can be more reliable and provide information on resources and where to find them. Second, information on the history of houses or buildings can be obtained from local authorities, such as National Archives and Property Registry. In addition, real estate realtors should be able to assist the purchasers with finding the basic information, like previous owners.

In conclusion, it appears that feeling satisfied and safe in the house we live in is a reason to discover its history, and online resources and local authorities could be the main source of the information.","## Task Achievement:

There are two main causes, building safety and the value of building. possible means for researching are providing information from city planners and neighbors.

Perhaps the major factor is that they tend to know whether the building is safe or not. Simply put, if a long time has passed since a house was built, it is possible that the materials used in the house are outdated. Therefore, not only is this building unsafe but it also costs extra to renovation. Additionally, the more a building is old, the more has value. Thus, when purchasing an old building, people can acquire profit when selling it.

Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animal species. Some people say that it is too late to do anything. Some people think that we should take effective action to improve the situation. Discuss both sides and give your opinion?,"in many recent years, the globe is going to be unhabitable for many life forms due to undesirable activities done by humans. As a result, protecting the environment and keeping plants and animals safe has become one of the most controversial issues among scientists and environmental activists. In this regard, some people claim that the current situation can not be improved, while others take the opposite side and believe that some practical decisions should be made. 

On the one hand, some people are of the opinion that the current trend that has been occurring in the world in recent decades is uncontrolled and can not be stopped easily. They believe population explosion and as a result, exploitation of nature and its resources such as water and plants in order to produce foodstuff and necessary products is unavoidable. This is because, in their statements, humans should take priority over all the other creatures. Therefore, it could be noted that, instead of investing huge amounts of either financial or human resources to save some rare species, which can be considered a waste of money because of their insufficiency, we ought to allocate this budget and workforce to enhance the health care and education system in poor countries. For instance, the latest statistics illustrate that the average budget of typical conservation programmes is equal to constructing 50000 schools in Africa where the majority of kids suffer from a lack of education.

On the other hand, many experts state that the current circumstances send a clear message that the globe is going to be unhabitable in the near future for all beings including mankind. This means that planning and implementing conservation programmes and strict rules in order to save special plants and animals not only help them to escape from the circle of extinction but also could shape our children's future in a far more efficient way. As a result, providing that the governments assist to keep the environment in balance by imposing harsh rules to deter factories and individuals from destroying nature, the position will be improved significantly. For example, in Germany, the government introduced harsh penalties for logging and poaching in 2006, which resulted in a substantial drop in the number of animals death figures after 10 years.

To sum up, although changing the available situation is a tough challenge and requires huge investment and international assessments, I firmly believe that this is possible to tackle this problem only if authorities take practical steps.","## Task Achievement:

However, the solution of more plantations may not become possible due to excessive soil erosion and lack of land.

On the other hand, people believe that circumstances can be made under control if effective measures are taken right away.To begin with,if the community has already realised the value of planting trees , then the government should make provisions related to logging.Moreover , advanced technology can prove effective in protecting endangered animals.For example, China has been utilising genetic technology, especially to protect panda's life.Additionally , the crowd ought to be encouraged to plant more and more trees.Therefore , the adoption of these solutions can be helpful in tackling global concerns directly from the root level.

Discuss both sides and give an opinion","In this era, the expanding human population are demanding to have more and more new land for them to build a house and earn money from nature. However, these actions may cause the extinction of biodiversity, therefore, some people said that our care towards the environment from now on can be very life-changing. Meanwhile, others think that whatever we try to improve will be useless. This writing will discuss both views following reasons, examples, and the writer's view at the end. 

Nowadays, people are utilizing natural resources exaggeratedly and causing some animal habitats destroyed. For instance, cutting down trees and clearing forest areas can be destructive for some plants and creatures that are living there. In addition, human's greedy and self-centred behaviour will never feel enough of what they have achieved so they will continuously distract their sphere. Moreover, after realising what they have done and how messy it is now, they lose their hope to improve the world and feel like it is too late to start over.

On the other hand, several communities have started to do many positive works for the environment such as reforestation, processing waste, and making regulations so that people do not destroy the biosphere for their own goods. These actualizations are good because slowly but surely they will bring advantages towards society. For example, knowing that our future life is in danger, we need to make a straightforward solution, one of which is by making a rule, particularly about preserving nature. By that, everyone will notice and diminish their destructive habits.

In conclusion, what people do now will bring crucial impacts later on. The sooner one realizes what has happened, the more possibility available to change things. As a human, people can start to take care of their surroundings to reduce environmental damage. Thereby, the future world will be better to live.","**Task Achievement:**

"Human activities have negative effects on plant and animals species. Some people think it 

is too late to do a anything about this problem. Others believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation.

Discuss both views and give our opinion.","Although humans have long acknowledged the impacts of their actions on flora and fauna systems, they still continue destroying them. And it is still a controversial issue whether it is better to find solutions for this urgent problem or let it be as it is already too late. In this essay, I will examine both viewpoints; however, I strongly believe that ""late is better than never"" and advocate finding ways to fix  mistakes.

Some people have stopped hoping to change the circumstance that many species of vegetation and animals have died out and more will become extinct in the foreseeable future. Humanity has influenced  biodiversity so badly that nature finds it so hard to recover. For example, when ones are in need of land for cultivation or construction, they cut down trees and cement the soil, resulting in  changes in the natural habitat. Consequently, many species of plants and animals can not survive.

Nevertheless, there is still a chance for us to err the mistakes provided that practical methods are put into action immediately. The prerequisite solution is the authorities had better set strict regulations protecting our nature such as ceasing deforestation and overexploitation. Nothing is more obvious than the example of overfishing which prevents fish from reproducing in time; as a consequence, they become extinct. Last but not least, more campaigns to enlighten every citizen's perceptions should be put into practice. Hopefully, when everyone is conscious of the danger of their actions on the common ecosystem, they will find ways to limit them.

Human activities have negative effects on plant and animal species. Some people think it is too late to do anything about this problem. Others believe effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"As natural resources are under increasing pressure, the list of endangered animals and plants is becoming endless. While some might claim that nothing could be done to reverse the trend, I believe that there are still means to ensure a sustainable future for the planet. 

Biodiversity contributes to humanity’s most important life-supporting safety net: nutrition, shelter, clothing, the very water we drink, and the air we breathe. However, our safety net is stretched almost to the breaking point. It is reported that natural forest area continues to decline, marine ecosystems are undermined severely, and countless species are suffering from illegal poaching. Hence, there are increasing voices that question the necessity and viability of making a change. 

Nevertheless, to reverse biodiversity decline, I believe, is still feasible, though difficult. 

Governments could promote a greater understanding of plants and animals by investing in the research and preservation efforts of universities, zoos, and botanical institutes. This may ensure the survival of individual species and produce tangible benefits in the form of new medicines and products. 

An alternative strategy would be to protect natural habitats by expanding nature reserves. This would have immediate positive consequences for those areas by preserving delicate ecosystems. The most effective solution is to limit the damage at the source. Companies that engage in practices that harm the environment should be required to demonstrate that they have taken all reasonable efforts to minimize the damage. Public contracts for roads and buildings should only be awarded to firms that have a good environmental track record. The strategies outlined above could do much to reverse the destruction that threatens the world’s plants and animals. 

To conclude, a planet being pushed to the edge will eventually turn on us. 

With the accelerating rate of mass extinctions of plant and animal species, I believe, effective measures should be taken immediately to make a difference.","### Task Achievement:

Human activities have negative effects on plant and animal species . Some Human activities have negative effects on plant and animal species. Some people think it is too late to do anything about this problem. Others believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give our opinion.,"Some actions of mankind have detrimental effects on flora and fauna. It is believed that there is no time for people to redress their mistakes while some people think that this circumstance can be effectively improved by various solutions. From my perspective, I have a strong belief that several measures can be taken to solve this problem.

To begin with, some people have right reasons to claim that it is an unsolvable problem and nothing can be done to deal with it. Deforestation or climate change caused by human activities is so destructive that it is placing many species’lives at risk. As a consequent, many species of plants and animals are dying due to loss of habitat and human’s hunt. Some of them have already become extinct, thus negatively affecting the balance of the ecosystem. For example, in Vietnam where there used to be a large number of tigers, this animal has been hunted for years to satisfy human’s needs and there are only few species left. 

However, I strongly argue that there are a lot of things that goverments and individuals can do to deal with this problem. Firstly, the issue of deforestation needs to be addressed. It is the main cause of the disapperance of endangered species around the world. Governments can plant more trees to create places for animals and plants to live and develop their population. Moreover, strict rules should be published to deter people from cutting down trees and hunting for precious animals and plants. Another solution is to raise awareness of residents about the destructive effects of our activities to the Earth and the ecosystem. Public talks and lectures about the possible consequences of mankind need to be hold in order to make the public aware of their activities. 

In conclusion, although some people think that there is nothing to solve this problem, I personally believe that there are many effective solutions to solve it. The protection of forest and the awareness of the public are really important in dealing with this issue.","**Task Achievement: 4**

Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animal species. Some people say that it is too late to do anything. Some people think that we should take effective action to improve the situation. Discuss both sides and give your opinion. ??,"In our contemporary world, humans have had a destructive impact on the environment and other living creatures. The majority of the population believe that we should take action to preserve our planet, while others have a more critical opinion. Throughout this essay I will discuss both points of view and express my personal opinion on this matter. Firstly, I will discuss the first opinion and ,secondly I will explore the second point of view.

On the one hand, today's modern society contemplate that people should reconsider their actions in order to maintain our world safe. Our extensively destructive activities have pushed many plants and animal species to the edge of extinction and changing even some simple routines and taking a more eco-friendly approach in our life might offer a great deal of improvement to our natural world. For example, if a person walks or rides a bicycle for a short journey rather than driving a car they will cut in carbon dioxide emission effectively and as a result, fresher air would be available in the local community.

On the other hand, there are some people who think that it is too late to even think about saving our planet. They believe that simple individual-based changes would not contribute to any improvement and they can not do anything about this matter. They do not consider themselves responsible for what is happening to the natural world and they are more into blaming ruling authorities for everything. In addition, they hold the government responsible to take serious measurements in order to save the environment. For instance, it is the government's responsibility to implement rules on industries to use filters to minimise the emission of toxic materials.

In conclusion,  Even though the government is the one who can take some serious measures to maintain our planet safe for citizens and other living organisms, humans can also take part in improving their local climate by following some simple actions. In my opinion, we should always feel responsible for the earth we live in and we must ensure the well-being of our habitat.","**Task Achievement:**

Human activities have a negative effect on plant and animal species. Some people say that it is too late to do anything. Some people think that we should take effective action to improve the situation. Discuss both sides and give your opinion. ??,"There are controversial perspectives heating up a debate over how to solve the negative effect issue caused by human activities on plant and animal species. While some hold a strong view that it is too late to measure the problem, the opposite makes a statement that we should enhance the situation with effective actions. I would contend that take effective actions to revamp the matters, which do more good than harm.

 It is obvious to note that there are many reasons to convince that it is too late in order to solve the negative effect of human activities on plant and animal species, one of them is deforestation. Having an ever-growing demand for land to live and wood to consume, humans decide on deforestation to serve their purpose. Therefore, it leads to flora and fauna being indiscriminately destroyed and lost completely instead of being replaced and it pushes many categories of species on the verge of extinction.  For example, Panda is China’s national treasure, but this species is on the brink of extinction because of deforestation. There is a wealth of animals in the world that are dying out because of human activities, which is the reason people doubt that it is too late to tackle the problem. 

 While the redeeming features of negative effects of human activities on flora and fauna species are widely acknowledged, we will find an address in order to enhance the issue. Plant and animal species play a paramount significant role in human’s life, so we should find a solution as soon as possible. One of the remedies is to build a reserve to create a safe habitat for endangered animals. For instance, Cuc Phuong national park in Vietnam is built and overseen by the authorities, which is home for a wave of precious animals. Hence, the situation will be resolved and revamped if people actively implement it.             

 In conclusion, although there are many reasons to prove that it is too late to deal with the negative effect on plant and animal species caused by human activities, people should take effective action to improve the problem.","**Task Achievement:**

Other people believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Human being has always been abusing the mother earth since the industrial revolution. Almost every kind of environmental problem or animal distinction, are the negative result of human activities. Some people believe that we can still save our planet and immediate actions must be taken. Others think that these actions are just grasping at straws. In my opinion, both approaches are equally reasonable, but personal statements vary.

Some people believe that we can take proactive approaches to save plants and animals. For example, panda has once been taken as dangerous distinctive species, but with the effort of many zoologists, pandas are being transfered to a much safer environment, such as the zoo, witch can insure the conservation of them. Now, we can see pandas in zoos all around the world, the number of pandas are surely secured.

On the other hand, some people say that such actions can never keep up with the damages made by human. Some disruptions are irreversible, like the ozone hole, it takes centuries for it to recover. Before that, animals and plants may suffer from drought and forest fire. Moreover, according to Darwin’s Natural Selection, it is quite natural for animals to die out. Dinosaurs become extinct because of the volcano explosion, and it is unnatural to preserve them or even bring them back to life. We surely don’t want to see such horrible nightmares like the movie Jurassic Park to happen in real life.

In conclusion, some people nowadays engage in environmental events, and devoted themselves to protect the living creatures on earth. While some only take passive actions. I believe that although there are chances that these protective actions are useless, we should’t give up on doing so. If we don’t give it a try, we will never know what we can accomplish.","**Task Achievement:** 5.5

Human activities have negative effects on plants and animal species. Some people think that it is too late to do anything about this problem. Other people believe that effective measures can be taken to improve this situation. Discuss both views and give your opinion.,"Environmental conservation has become a trending topic in recent years. Pessimists claim that there is nothing that can be done to save the Earth, while others argue that human beings still have a chance to modify the situation. In my view, I agree with the latter and I will provide an explanation with examples.

First of all, it is undeniable that human activities have brought a number of serious problems to the Earth due to the increase in human demands based on populations. For instance, the average temperature has increased one Celsius since the 1800s, which mainly caused by deforestation, farming and burning fossil fuels. This leads to a threat to many Arctic species such as polar bears in particular as their habitat is melting and disappearing.

On the other hand, others including me believe there is still hope because the awareness of environmental protection and sustainable development has raised in recent decades. To be more precise, many countries have started to tackle the negative effects brought by human beings, like reducing overexploitation of natural resources. Instead, professionals are researching and finding other renewable and Eco-friendly resources to limit the demands on fuels. Besides, afforestation is encouraged to offset the damage by deforestation. China is one of the best examples, which the overall forest coverage rate has risen from twelve per cent in the early 1980s to twenty-three per cent currently. As a result, the air quality in China has improved dramatically compared with thirty years ago.

In conclusion, even if human activities have caused grave consequences and even some permanent damage to our plants and wildlife, it is not completely irretrievable as long as human beings can learn from previous mistakes and insist on sustainable development.","### Task Achievement: 8

"Some people think that children should be taught at school to recycle

materials and avoid waste. Other people believe that children should be taught

this at home.

Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.","It is often argued that schools should own the responsibility to give awareness among youngsters about goods recycling and waste depletion whilst others disagree and thinks that homes are considered as a better learning place for kids for such education. While primary educational institutes are considered to be the initial learning place for growing minds, I believe that parents' and grandparents' contributions can not be neglected. In this essay, I will discuss in favour of school rather than the living place as a suitable land for children to understand the importance of recycling and discourage waste production with relevant examples.

 There is no doubt that kids always follow what they see in their daily routines. Kids spend 65% of their time in homes which gives them an opportunity to mingle with family members. As a result, their learning is based on observations. Parents and others should follow the practice of recycling disposals and garbage reduction. Such materials are but not limited to; Card boxes & Plastics. For example, a number of youtube channels are available that convey a plethora of ideas about recycling such as wastage and because of the hectic routine of the elder generation, kids are often provided with a variety of electronic devices that keep them engaged. As a consequence, they learn with fun at home with their best interest.

On the hand, Schools are another professional hub for the young generation equipped with modernized facilities that make learning more interesting. I believe that courses can be designed to make recycling and waste prevention a compulsory subject. Setup the special labs that illustrate the types of reusable materials, the process of recycling, and the reduction in litter production could develop a sense of maturity among children at an early age. For instance, The Kenedy School in Brisbane is well known for its achievement in making the world's first prototype of the recycling process together with waste depletion techniques. However, it comes at a massive cost. 

 

To recapitulate, it is vital for children to learn about reusable products and the reduction in the generation of disposals. However, the part played by early educational institutes in this regard outweighs the knowledge transferred by inhabitants as school facilities significantly impact their learning process.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think it would be beneficial for school children to study international news as a school subject, while others argue it would be a waste of time.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","It is commonly known that many species have gone extinct throughout history, including the dinosaurs. Some argue that preventing extinction is not necessary, as it is a natural process. However, I believe that humans have a moral obligation to protect endangered species and prevent their extinction.

Firstly, human activities such as deforestation, overfishing, and pollution have caused a rapid decline in animal populations, leading many species to be at risk of extinction. As a result, humans have a responsibility to conserve the environment and prevent further harm to wildlife. It is unfair for humans to cause the extinction of a species due to their actions, particularly when they have the ability to prevent it.

Another reason is that many species play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. For example, bees are essential pollinators that are responsible for pollinating 80% of flowering plants, and thus if bees were to become extinct, it would have a devastating impact on our food supply and ecosystem. Similarly, the loss of predators can cause a ripple effect, leading to overpopulation of other species and causing imbalances in the food chain.

Lastly, preventing extinction is not only a matter of responsibility but also a matter of morality. Species have intrinsic value, and it is not our place to determine which species should exist and which should not. Humans must respect the inherent value of all life forms and do what they can to protect them.

In conclusion, while extinction may be a natural process, it is not a justification for humans to sit idly by and watch as countless species go extinct. By taking action to conserve the environment, humans can ensure that future generations can enjoy the same diversity of life that we have today.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.

Discuss both sides and five your opinion.","Today, teaching  art in schools is the subject of dispute between people who regard  art as really necessary for children and individuals who find art a waste of time. In my view, art does not play an important role in a child's development.

         Many people consider that art should be taught in schools since children need it to change and make fresh their brain. Because art can be a factor for them to learn how to concentrate their mind on one thing. During art lessons children are required to focus on one particular thing, so art can help to learn to pay attention to also their other necessary works. As a result, they can be productive in their other subjects. Therefore art is vital for everyone, especially child's development. 

     On the other hand , there are also people who believe art subject is not required from  children in school. It can take the child's most   time which must be spent on their more crucial subject as realm-related ones. As a result of this, they do not have adequate knowledge of their vital subjects since they spend their precious time on art. 

    In conclusion, nowadays, while many people argue that art is not a key factor to a child's education and should not be taught in  schools , others believe art has a big influence on a child's school life, and later also. I am of the opinion that art should be taught in schools as the second statement is that art should be taught in schools as it can help  children's improvement.","### Task Achievement:

"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.

Discuss both sides and give your opinion","Nowadays, whether art subject should be taught at school or not has become a matter of concern. Some people think art is essential for students and the country, while others oppose this viewpoint. This essay will discuss both views and give a relevant opinion on them.

To begin with, art is an essential subject for students in terms of positive development. Students learn about their country's history, culture, and traditions. For example, a country like India has diverse cultures and traditions it is important for the citizen to have knowledge of their country when they move to different parts that will help to a certain extent. Moreover, art is good for mental health, as subjects like math and science are very frustrating and stressful, whereas art helps to relax the mind and Borden the thinking process. Hence, art has an essential place in schools

On the other hand, some people deny this idea of teaching art subjects in schools. First and foremost, taking subjects like math, science and computer provide a better opportunity in their career. For example, artists like painters and singers can hardly manage daily expenses, whereas doctors, managers, and IT professionals get enough to save for the future. In addition, those who graduate from engineering, business, and medical science make more contributions in terms of the country's economic development like improving infrastructure, increasing life expectancy, and increasing country's revenue with better management. 

In Conclusion, although art is very helpful for students to rejuvenate their minds, get off from a hectic schedule, and learn about their country's history and traditions, science and business subjects help the countries grow more. In my opinion, art and science hold special positions. They should be taught; equally; it should be dependent on students and what they like.","## Task Achievement:

Some people think that secondary school children should study international news as one of the school subjects. Other people think that it is a waste of valuable school time. What do you think? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"There is a public debate on whether middle schools should have a subject about global news, while some people argue about it. Recently, many big issues have happened all around the world. Especially, the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia is very sad news for everyone. I personally believe that students need to learn about what is going on outside of their countries during school time. This essay discusses the advantages and disadvantages of creating such a subject at secondary schools and my opinion will be provided. 

 I opine that international news classes are essential for the following reason. Learning about the topic associated with other countries leads students to expanding their perspectives. To illustrate, an international school in Tokyo where students come from various countries originally have a unique class in which kids take one topic and discuss it from a a cultural and regional point of view. As a result, students can get different ways of thinking and one of the graduates becomes the CEO of the biggest IT company. Exposure to contemporary affairs from a young age makes them become global citizens who are needed to think of things from a variety of perspectives.

On the other hand, it has a negative aspect as well. A potential disadvantage of this subject is that overseas affairs sometimes contain strong political and religious aspects. Education for kids is supposed to be away from politics and religion because they might affect who they are. For example, children in Iran, where they are taught to be soldiers at school, believe what is taught, therefore they  are fighting as a soldier without any doubt. Hence, global news including such things might affect who they are.

 In conclusion, I believe that the advantages of learning about international news as one of the subjects outweigh the drawbacks that it might bring. I suggest that secondary schools should set such a subject in a curriculum in order to make students exposed to various issues in the world, however, educators need to be careful about the negative aspect.","**Task Achievement: 6.5**

"Some people believe that children at school should learn art, others says it is a waste of time.

Some believe that teenagers should learn art at an early age, while others would say that It is waste of time as well as money. This essay strongly agrees with Children should learn the art field because It increases their creativity and develops their minds. 

The primary reason students learn arts is that It improves their problem-solving skills. This is because If they learn painting and many more arts improve their mental abilities as well as develop their mind as well. For instance, a study conducted by American Management School found that around 60 per cent of teenagers who learn arts they are well performed in maths subjects because of their problem-solving abilities. 

Another reason is that they are more creative than any other children. Arts means creativity and if schools teach artists so, teenagers improve their creativity at an early stage. For example, an article published by BBC news showed that approximately 30 per cent of students learn arts at their starting days more creative than any others students. In addition, people encourage their children to become musicians and dancers.

Some people think that children should learn to paint and draw. Others believe that is a waste of time. Discuss both views.,"There are conflicting views about whether children should learn arts or not. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument，followed by my own perspective.

Firstly, studying these subjects of children may have more fun after school.

If it is a free choice to choose what they want to learn after class, they will

feel much happier without stress of school. If arts are touched when they

feel relaxed, the different kinds of knowledge will be received that their

brain might relate all skills easier. If the knowledge and skills are learned,

then they will be inspired to use original ways to think, which can

encourage their creative thinking.

However, those who support the idea of learning paint and draw is a waste of time can also justify their opinion. Some parents think the successful education means high ranking of exams that can make their development better in the future. So these children need to focus more on academic subjects, like Math, English......and spending more time to study skills to prepare for exams instead of learning arts.

In my opinion, children should learn paint and draw at an early age. Although some people believe that is important to study main subjects in school. In fact, giving freedom and relaxation to learn arts could help them to study other subjects with related. And receiving creative thinking by knowledge in different fields that can be really an advantage in the future development of the children.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people think that children should study in school the subject of science of food and how to prepare it properly. Other think it is a waste of time, because there are more important subjects to study. Discuss both views and give your opinion with reasons and relevant examples.""","A few people feel that food science should be added to school curriculum whereas others opine that preference should be given to learning other important subjects such as maths and science. In my opinion, it is crucial for children to understand) the benefits of food and learn cooking in school as knowledge about food will help them remain / stay healthy throughout their life and also cooking is a basic skill which everyone should learn from their early days.

As children easily get influenced by their teachers it would be a good idea to make them learn the importance of the right food in school. This is because nowadays social media and television are full of advertisements related to unhealthy food options. So, if a child is aware of food science and how nutritious food would keep their body fit, that would encourage them to choose correct food habits. In addition, cooking is a necessity and should be taught to everyone. The curriculum should have a subject such as home science where students can be taught how to prepare their own food. It would motivate them to indulge themselves in home-cooked food instead of spending money on junk food available in markets.

Others who think school days should be used for learning important subjects such as maths and science would argue that these subjects help students in making successful careers later in life. Moreover, in their view, teaching students to learn cooking would distract them from the main subjects. This might lead to students performing poorly in important career-making subjects. However, in today’s time when childhood obesity is being very common, incorporating food science as a subject in the school curriculum might help in curbing this issue. Also, there should be just one or two hours a week for learning to cook. This way, it will have no impact on children’s focus on core subjects.

To conclude, in my opinion, along with important career-making subjects, students should be taught the science of food as it will encourage them to pursue a healthy lifestyle.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people believe that holidays are necessary for students, others think that children should not have holidays because it is just a waste of time. Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, it  is a moot issue whether children should have holidays or not. It is  believed by a lot of individuals that it shouldn't be, others think that it's just a waste of time,however.From my perspective, it is necessary that children have some free time from their work so, they could relax or learn something new that they haven't yet.

Learning something new that is not related to  academics is the thing that is quite beneficial for them. Since If they would have some time from their main studies that they are having, then they learn something different activities and learn some skills: public speaking cooking time management and so on, which would be beneficial in that they later live especially for take any job and to interact with others.

Have time for recreational activities is another merit of having vacations. It is generally seen that by learning their academics  for a whole year continuously, they get rid of it. So they want some time for them. For instance, many pieces of research proved that if children devote some of their time to activities that help them to be relaxed then it would be better for them as they could perform much better in the exams.

"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.
Discuss both views and give your opinion.","Nowadays, there is a highly debate about whether art should remain as a crucial subject at school or not.Some people admit that art should be considerd as one of the compulsory subjects school curriculum because it help to enhance students imagination and release stress.On the other hand, some individuals opine that art is not worth for pupils' time since they should put more afford and concentrate on the main subjects.Personally, I sided with the opinion that art should be taught at school. 

To begin with, children will have space to develop their ideas and imagination through pieces of art they creted, they are able to express the emotions,thoughts and creativities through their work which cure them from depression and stress.This happened because kids perceived art as a subject with 'no right and wrong' answer, so they are allowed to be themselves as much as they desire. Furthermore,it is another helpfut alternative for them to discover themselves before they stepped in to the real world.For instance, the recent study showed that the average pupils chose Art for their major in universities rose dramatically in the past decades.

On the contrary, individauls may claim that kids ought to focus and put an extra afford on other important question such as Math,Science or International launguages.Therefore, they will have more oppotunity to widen their acdemic skills for their further study; which will lead them to several stable and high income occupations.For example, students who are eligible for pursuing a doctor degree need to get high scores on both Science and Math, this mean they. need to study harder to achive the achievement

"Some people think that art is essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.
Discuss both sides and give your opinion.","In recent years, the question of whether art should be taught at school has been a matter of debate. Some maintain that art should be an integral part of the study; however, there is another school of thought which dismisses this notion as they deem that it is the dissipation of time. In this essay, I will discuss both assertions and conclude that it is of paramount importance.

The most powerful argument in favour of art being on the school curriculum is its profoundly positive impact on the development of children’s cognitive skills. By participating in art activities, children deploy a wide range of accomplishments, like decision-making, thereby enhancing them. Not only can art help children have a fertile imagination, but also promotes lateral thinking in them. It can, therefore, have far-reaching implications, as this expertise are also crucial to learning other subjects; hence it appears logical to suggest that art improve outcomes in all subjects.

Notwithstanding  these substantial benefits, it seems this subject is of no consequence to some. They point out schools should prioritise core subjects, like physics, arguing STEM skills are vital for students’ future lives and art is worthless. Given the fact that not all pupils have the opportunity to pursue their interest in art academies or at home, was art excluded from the school curriculum, they would not be able to understand the value of the arts, nor would those who are artistically inclined hone their skills. 

In conclusion, I subscribe to the theory that art should be a part of the curriculum in view of the fact art education is critical to students’ personal and educational development, and it is inextricably linked to other disciplines as it can foster those skills also needed for them.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think that children should be taught at school to recycle materials and avoid waste. Other people believe that children should be taught this at home.

Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.","In recent times, it is paramount to recycle plastic bags, bottles etc. To reduce the wastage of natural and man-made resources and to improve its usefulness. Many people argue that children should learn this skill of recycling objects at school, while others insist that parents should teach this to their children.  I admit that parents can act as a guide or mentor, but I firmly believe that in academy students can get practical knowledge also. This essay will discuss both the views by demonstrating facts and points.

To begin with, it is very important to protect the environment from getting polluted. For this, schools can introduce a compulsory subject of waste management in the curriculum. Therefore, children will learn more about it as dedicated time slot will be allocated for exploring this issue. Moreover, children will get hands-on experience and practical knowledge too. It is evident that cognition and intellectual skills are developed more by performing group activities. Peers play a vital role in encouraging and inculcating interest in things which aloof individual finds hard to incur. So, school can act as a channel to motivate its students in reducing the misuse.

On the other hand, kids at home imitate what their parents do. For example, the way parents eat, communicate, etc. Similarly, parents should imbibe the habits of reducing and reusing left over items in themselves, which will be ultimately inherited to the next generation. It has been always stated that home is the first school of the kids. Therefore, parents should indulge their kids in such activities and help then in becoming responsible citizens of the nation. 

 To conclude, parents are the primary source of the knowledge of the kids and what parents can do nobody can do. But, by performing real-time activities with class fellows  can have a long lasting effect on the minds of growing kids.  Thus, they can contribute in a better way in waste management and make this world a better place to live.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people think that secondary school children should study international news as one of the school subjects. Other people think that it is a waste of valuable school time. What do you think? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"The never-ending debate of adding foreign news as one of the subjects of secondary school syllabus is not new. However, the news of overseas current affairs opens the doors for opportunities in indirect ways.   I believe that international news must be a part of the school syllabus for various useful reasons that will be discussed in this essay further. 

Since globalization has arrived and the internet has made everything clear, many students entail a lot of knowledge about world affairs. The growth of efficient organizations in developing countries is opening numerous opportunities for everyone. For example, technology innovations in a country like China are mindblowing, many engineers or technical students from developed countries wish to work in companies situated in China. All these news let the students explore what is going on in the world, and where they can be fitted. Moreover, we all are learning from each other; the success or failure of one country's economy is a lesson for others. For instance, a less peaceful country would look into the reforms of the most peaceful countries - i.e. Newzealand or Canada. Therefore, knowledge lets countries learn from each other. 

Measuring the other benefits; helps students to know about the areas on which the world is competing. Like sports, Television, E-sports and other activities that give countries get power and fame. For example, there are stories of heroes they share online that helps student boost their confidence and morale. Besides, it might help the students in different fields to explore information about their subjects. We can take an example of medical students who can gain knowledge of different disease testing equipment or methods that are used in developed countries. In short, obtaining overseas news opens the intellectual horizons and thoughts of students. 

To summarize, I would suggest that students should know what is happening around the world so that they should adapt to positive change in their life. In my opinion, international news lets students learn practically; whereas, bookish knowledge becomes hard to apply in practical life without examples.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think that secondary school children should study international news as one of the school subjects. Other people think that it is a waste of valuable school time. 
Discuss both views.","When considering what to be taught in secondary school, people are still divided about whether international news should be one of the official subjects or not. While there are benefits to adding this new channel into the classroom, there are also good reasons why it might be helpful to only focus on current curricula. 
The statement that international news should be studied at secondary school is strong for several reasons. In terms of social view, it would help students to gain a wider perspective of the world. In this way, youngsters can be widely acknowledged with current affairs so that they could be aware of how to behave properly. Moreover, in the education view, international news accompanied by different academic subjects such as science, literature, mathematics would complete the integrated learning, which provides students with a full development to lead their life in the future. It is, therefore, clear that global updating plays a vital role in assisting education
On the other hand, it is also understandable that including international news as a subject in secondary school curricula is definitely irrelevant. First, students are now snowed with a hectic schedule, which may result in overloading if any additions. Moreover, in the current education system, especially examination, it places a great emphasis on academic subjects, if students don’t concentrate enough on these qualifications, they might fail. Secondly, the violence represented in many of today's news could affect students' performance. This is because, at the secondary school’ age, students are still inexperienced to understand those negative aspects. So the youngsters tend to misjudge the situations and act inappropriately. Therefore, the study of international news would be a destructive and wasteful use of school resource.
In conclusion, there are convincing arguments for the study of global news into secondary school, but it is also reasonable that it shouldn’t add to be an official subject.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think that art is an essential subject for children at school while others think it is a waste of time.
Discuss both views and give your opinion","People have different views about whether art should become one of important subjects for the youth or not. While many arguments assume that learning about art at school is time consuming, others are on the contradicting view. Personally, I would contend that art should be taught in optional courses.
On the one hand, there are some reasons for the idea of removing art classes from school’s schedule. One realistically cogent reason is that art is not an essential skill for life survival. People still can find a job and earn for living without an art talent. In fact, there are not many job opportunities for artists compared with other common sectors, hence, some parents would incline to equip their children with academic knowledge rather than art techniques so that kids’ future would be guaranteed with an easier and brighter career path. Therefore, it is not unreasonable for those who consider that spending time for these subjects is such a waste resulting in their intention of the cancellation.
On the other hand, there are some points of view that support the necessary of art courses in school. It can be seen that practicing art activities could develop the young generation’s creativities. Besides, initial art classes could help children explore their passion and ability, thereby gradually germinate and evolve their talent. Moreover, a few hours of learning art could be able to help children relax after other academic subjects.
However, to my mind, although there are both merits and drawbacks of art courses, they should not be completely removed or become an essential subject. I believe some kids enjoy doing art, others might feel uncomfortable. Hence, I would like to suggest that school can make these courses optional. It should depend on the youth to decide to participate in or not.
In conclusion, there are pros and cons for spending time for art in school, nevertheless, everyone deserve to freely make their own decision for how they spend in education stage.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people say that economic growth is the only way to end hunger and poverty, while others say that economic growth is damaging environment so it must be stopped. Disscuss both view and give your opinion?","Is developing economy harmful to the environment or saving our land from being destroyed constantly by human ignorance and greed?  The answer is positive.

In recent years, extreme environmentalists acclaimed that their activities, including protesting and advocating for conservation and improvement are the best way to avoid our planet being damaged inevitably. Other people argued that the growing economy would resolve the problems of scarcity and starvation, which are the real causes of environmental destructing somehow nowadays.

Firstly, starvation and scarcity of resource are important issues in our world, but resolving these problems are not standing on the opposite side of environmental protection. They are not topics in the same category. The efforts striving to improve the prosperity of society aren't meant it's damaging our nature,  but for which, is now being protected by lots of advanced technics attributed to economic growth. For example, in Ning Xia, a province of northwest China, local peasants have benefited from the increasing economy and technologies and can have better measures to protect grasslands. 

On the other hand, ending hunger and poverty, along with protecting the environment, which one is the prior issue? For some perspective of environmentalists, the best earth is a world without any human species. There would be no hunger and poverty issues if human beings never existed before. That is ridiculous. The environment is not a stationary object that never changed since the birth of our mother planet. It doesn't need to worry about our world excessively, because it has experienced so many extinctions and rebirths after numerous catastrophes and keeping vibrant now.

First, of ,course one of the ways to reduce  global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel, which makes people think twice before using their car or turning on the heating, They will use it at the needed time, not every time. For instance, I remember when I was in Syria and petrol was very expensive, we had not used it a lot, and we heated one room instead of three.

Second, there were a lot of methods to make people reduce using  fuel, like decreasing the price of electronic cars, encouraging them to ride the popular buses or trains and making workshops to be aware of the environment and their problems. For example, I have my own car, and I look forward to having an electronic car but it is so expensive compared to mine or normal cars.

Some people think the government should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles in order to solve environment problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Many people argue that environmental issues are needed to be solved strictly by the government's policy of increasing the cost of private vehicles. Personally, it is a useful measure, but other measures might be more effective.

There are some underlying reasons why authorities should make an effort to raise petrol prices. Firstly,  it would limit the number of car journeys and the money raised could be used to improve public transport. Because of the sharp rise in appearance and convenience of cars, humans forget the harmfulness of using their vehicles related to the environment. Therefore, the government should upgrade and expand public transport provided by the cost of private vehicle users. Moreover, more goods would travel by rail. It is clear that freight services and the useful solution former would reduce vehicle emissions and the greenhouse effect.

Apart from the practical measures mentioned above, I believe that other solutions are more effective. There are more and more traffic jams happening on the road daily, especially during rush hours. In this situation, congestion charges should be the best idea to improve transport infrastructure.For instance, London's government used this method to avoid traffic congestion influenced directly by transport facilities. Additionally, free bus and train passes are other measures that helped to reduce the use of cars and improve air quality. Local authorities should subsidize the cost of fares to encourage people in using public transport.

You should write at least 250 words.","With the rising number of environmental issues , many suggest that increasing the prices of vehicles and car fuels will help save the escalating situation , I totally agree that this solution will contribute positively as it will force people to replace their fuel-working vehicles with electric ones or rely on public transportation and also it's known that around the world nations that provide cheap fuel prices suffer with environmental hardships the most.

To begin with , a surge in the prices of fuel can lead to pleasant outcomes , if it were to occur in a particular nation people will start to think about alternatives that could be more environmentally safe , for instance , the government of Norway , is known for its harsh taxation policies against fuel products , therefore , the number of electric cars sold in the country is one of the most worldwide .

In addition , countries that have low gas prices are said to be the most polluted , moreover , people in these states heavily depend on fuel-based cars , for example , Saudi Arabia has one of the cheapest gasoline prices in the world , given that fact , almost everyone ones a car ran by it , furthermore , it's one of the most polluted places according to the Air Quality Index , however ,in recent years the Saudi government has been funding public transportation and making it cheap and accessible for everyone , and this based on other countries experiences , will surely be a positive development for the surroundings .

To sum up , increasing the prices of fuel products is an effective way to reduce pollution, as it will make individuals seek  other means of transport , on the contrary , it's evident that doing the opposite and declining the prices can be very harmful and have a lot of serious consequences.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"The world is now surrounded by many urgent environmental problems, and many people feel that raising the cost of fuel is one of the most effective ways of combatting them. Although I tend to agree with this viewpoint, I believe there are other environmental measures that need to be taken. 

Increasing petrol prices would help save the environment in many ways. As the number of vehicles on the roads is increasing dramatically, so is the amount of vehicular emissions released into the atmosphere. However, if governments increase fuel costs, this solution would serve as a deterrent for people who drive their private cars, reducing air pollution and ozone layer depletion. Besides discouraging people from driving their private cars, this would also generate income to make further investments in environmental initiatives. Given these potential benefits of raising fuel prices, is it hardly surprising to see so many countries applying it to practice.

Apart from increasing the cost of fuel, we can also implement other solutions to environmental issues. For instance, on an individual level, people who want to help the environment should become more environmentally responsible by buying eco-friendly products, and reusing and recycling plastic bags. They can also take public transport as opposed to their personal cars, which produce toxic fumes. From a government’s perspective, it is essential to switch to green energy sources, such as solar and wind, rather than continuing to rely on gas and petrol. Thus, environmental protection goes beyond just raising fuel prices. 

In conclusion, though I attach great importance to the practice of increasing fuel costs, I think that both individuals and governing bodies should become environment-oriented in their mindset to tackle environmental problems.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.,"Raising the price of petrol for vehicles and other transportation is one of the best ways for some people who believe that can solve 

environmental problems. I would like to share some of my opinions about it.

First of all, I agree that increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles is one of the best ways to solve environmental problems because nowadays there are too many cars running on the streets. Almost everyone has a car and does not like to use public transport because it is difficult to go to work by bus or metro ,especially from a suburb. However, if the government can raise the price of petrol and make their transportation systems more friendly, it will make citizens and tourists use it generally due to the financial concerns.

Secondly, the government can make some packages for the public transportation to inspire people to take them instance of driving their own cars. For example, if people can get discount from taking public transportation, they will be willing to do it from time to time. Besides, between different places, the governments can build systems for people to bike, if it is convenient for everyone to rent bikes from one place and return to another, it will be more and more popular for people to use it and make the environment friendly.

On the other hand, it is not only because  the cars produce too much carbonatite but also many other facts. Due to many studies, climate-changing 

 is cost by many different issues which include making products related to meat, factories, agriculture...etc. Therefore, all of the facts cost different levels of environmental problems and it 

all results in climate-change.

In conclusion, though there are many issues cost the environmental problem, I believe it will have a good result if the fuel price increase and everyone will definitely be concerned about the cost and make new methods to itface.","## Task Achievement:

Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Increasing the price of fuel for cars and other vehicles is proposed to be one of the best ways to mitigate the issues in our environment. However, in my opinion, I am absolutely in disagreement with this statement. The reasons for this will be tackled in this essay.

First of all, increasing the price of fuel will only have a minimal impact on protecting our environment from pollution or climate change and will have a significant rebound negative impact on an individual level and on microenterprises. This will cause financial strain for the less fortunate, while the wealthy and large-scale business owners will most likely be unaffected. For these reasons, there will be a clash of temperaments and an increasing poverty level for those affected and could possibly lead to other issues like a rise in looting and crime rates.

Furthermore, there are other effective ways to address environmental issues, such as increasing the use of renewable energy and encouraging the use of recyclable materials.By doing such things, society can benefit more as recyclables are a more practical way of saving money. Furthermore, making use of our renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and water energy will help reduce the amount of fossil fuel circulating in the atmosphere. Thus, this will help aid in protecting our nature.

To summarize, repricing crude is not a practical or optimal solution to the environmental issues we face today. It will only hurt the poor and benefit the rich, which could create tension and, worse, lead to other societal issues such as a rise in crime rates. It is then imperative to consider the use of renewable sources of energy to conserve and aid the earth from pollution and climate change by reducing the amount of fossil fuel accumulation.","**Task Achievement:**

People think that goverments should increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles to solve envinronmental problems. Give your opinion,"It is certainly true that one solution to address environmental issues would be for the governments to raise the prices of petrol . Although i consider that this might be an effective measure, i believe that other measures have even more profound impacts. 


On the one hand, there are a variety of reasons why increasing the fuel prices is beneficial in addressing some of the environmental problems . Firstly, in terms of private cars, when the national authorities raise the taxes on petrol, motorists will have to limit the time and length of their journey. Therefore, governments will have more money to reinforce and update the public transport provision, as people still need to go the office, school or other medical health services like hospital, for example. Secondly, from the perspective of the freight services, more goods are transported by rail instead of truck. Thus, Both these measures will cut down on emissions and reduce the greenhouse effects. 


On the other hand, while this rise in fuel prices might be a stopgap measure, governments can adopt other policies which may be more effective in the long term. For instance, the local authorities in London have introduced a congestion charge on all vehicles visiting the city central. As a result, they have subsidized their money on some health awareness campaigns and spending on the transport infrastructure. In turn, there is a general decline in exhaust fumes from vehicles around the city centre and the air quality in the city has improved by this action.  Another policy could be to establish some free bus and train routes, as the increased use of public transport will alleviate pollution from private cars and help in the effort to combat global warming.


In conclusion, a sharp rise in petrol prices can be a useful environmentally friendly transport measure, although in the long term other steps will be more valuable","**Task Achievement:**

Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to  increase the cost of fuels for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree  with this statement?,"Over the past decades, environmental problems have never failed to draw public attention  and provoke debates. Although the severity and urgency of addressing environmental  problems properly are hardly arguable, the issue as to whether governments should deal with  these issues with higher price of fuels or not remains controversial. From my own perspective,  I consider this approach is ineffective.  Firstly, it is important to recognize that although the occurrence of positive outcome towards environment is almost inevitable, the final result may not be as expected for long. Some may  hold optimistic attitude that this particular approach would be the effect on limiting the  number of cars and thereby reducing the amount of environment-damaging gas emission. This  argument could be true to some extent. However, they should take into account the fact that  since the cost of public transport would also be affected, resistance in people with the need of  travel seems to be inevitable, hence the impossibility of achieving the desired goal. Therefore,  increasing fuel prices will not make any significant changes.  Secondly, it is equally important to recognize that there is evidence that waste gas from cars is  not the leading cause of air pollution. The opponents may argue that the combustion of fossil  fuels by cars is the main producer of carbon dioxide. Nevertheless, they are ignorant of the fact  that the chef culprit is the discharge of pollutants into the atmosphere due to the rapidly growing  manufacturing industry. Governments could better handle this problem if they could increase  control over industrial waste-discharge and adopt more environmental friendly materials and  production equipment. For example, wind and tidal power in the Netherlands, nuclear power in  Japan and solar power in the United States have all proven their efficiency  in energy  production. This example indicates that other solutions could be employed in other parts of the  world to minimize the global dependence on fossil fuel.  In conclusion, under no circumstances should increasing the price of fuels be taken as the best  solution to environmental issues, as it has neglected both the reaction of consumers and the  root cause of the problem as mentioned above.","## Task Achievement:

While I consider that this might be an effective measure, I would argue that other measures might have an even greater impact.
On the one hand, raising the cost of fuel for cars and other modes is one of the efficient way because of some reasons. Firstly, higher fuel prices can help to limit the number of car journeys. A large number of low and middle income earners are not able to afford the incease in the cost of petrol, therefore they are forced to adapt to other means of transport such as: bicycle, walking, train, bus, etc. Traveling by public transportation instead private cars is the necessary way to cut down on car emission and reduce greenhouse effect. Secondly, the extra money, which collected from increasing fuel prices can be used in order to compensate for the extra expense. Government can raise expenditure on upgrading and expand public facilities and transportation to suffice residents. 
On the other hand, while this rise in petrol costs might be a useful stopgap measure, national authorities could apply some other solutions to tackle this problem. The first measure is to invest money in developing eco-friendly means of transport. People should be encouraged to use electric cars and motorbikes to prevent air pollution. Moreover, introducing free bus and train passes, as the increased use of public transport would help in the effort to combat global warming. Another measure is to raise people awareness of the need to cut down on emissions from their cars. Environmental campaigns shoud be carried out more, especially on social media to popularize residents efficient ways to protect the environment.

"Some people think that the best way to solve global environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel.

To what extent do you agree or disagree.","It is believed by some people that increasing the prices of the fuel is the key to solving environmental problems. In my opinion, I completely agree with this statement.  Firstly, this essay will discuss on how this decision can reduce the emissions of dangerous gases releasing into the air and secondly, explain how it can decrease the overall consumption of this resource utilized by human beings for industrial purposes.
Increasing the price of fuel can reduce the number of vehicles travelling on the streets. This can prevent in emission of greenhouse gases, particularly from vehicles into the air and as a result, it reduces overall pollution, which is also one of the primary  contributing factors in environmental issues. For example, the United Kingdom has recently surged the prices of the fuel and it resulted in lesser traffic and even showed significant difference in the air quality due to lesser hazardous gases released. Therefore, it is clear that increasing the cost can actually make a difference to tackle this problem.
Another reason to consider inclining the prices of the fuel would directly reflect in the reduction of all other industries using fuel as a primary energy source. In other words, several industries use diesel and gas as a primary source of energy to provide electricity to their machines and now people will double check on spending hefty amounts which will eventually reduce the excess consumption of this resource and therefore look for renewable ways to run their machines. It is therefore playing a prominent role in tackling the contributing factors of environmental problems. Hence, it is patently evident that hiking the costs of the fuel is beneficial to the society.
In conclusion, surging the prices of the fuel can tackle environmental problems as it reduces the vehicles that emit gasses into the atmosphere and overall reduction of its consumption which are powering up machines. It is recommended that more and more countries should take this initiative for a better healthy air in the world.","**Task Achievement: 8**

"Some people think the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles.
To what extent, do you agree or disagree?
","It is commonly believed by many that inflating the cost of fuel is the most efficient way to solve environmental issues. I partially agree with them because I believe that although it is an important way but there are many other more effective ways of doing so.

On one hand, increase in the rate of fuel would definitely reduce the level of pollution to some extent. As increased rate will discourage people to use their vehicles unnecessarily, as it is a common trend to drive a car even though the distance is walkable. This will encourage people to use pooling of vehicle while going to same site. For instance, if five people from one community work in same office or location, it is the efficient to go by one car alternatively. This will also motivate them to use bicycles and public transport system. Thus, this will solve the problem to some extent.

On the other hand, I believe this is not the key method and there are many other effective ways to solve environmental issues such as growing more trees and avoid use of plastic bags. Plastic containers should be replaced by bio-degradable glass dishes. Also I believe that this change would provide some level of discomfort to the public as the public transport system in most of the countries are not very convenient. In short, only increasing the rate of fuel would not protect the environment, people have to become conscious about the surrounding and put their contribution by many other ways such as aforementioned.

In conclusion, I agree that inflated rates of fuel would decrease the environmental problems but it is not the most efficient way, as it will benefit the environment but may provide inconvenience to public. Only increasing the rate of fuel would not improve the adverse condition of our environment, many other measures need to be taken such as planting trees, choosing glass over plastic and using renewable resources instead of fossil fuels.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The earth's average surface temperatures are increasing every year by the pollutions which are emitted by vehicles. However, some people believe that the rise in fuel prices is the best way to solve environmental problems. Although it is a controversial statement, I completely disagree with this statement.

Firstly, it is important to solve the environmental problems due to the global warming effect on the earth's surface. Many harmful gases are released into the atmosphere by fuel vehicles, while electric vehicles can be the best way to this problem. For instance, electric vehicles do not emit any harmful gases into the atmosphere as it runs through electricity. Although it saves fuel, but it takes more time to charge. Whereas growing more trees is also a solution for that cause.

In contrast, many people cannot afford those electric cars, so they use normal fuel  vehicles.
Raise in petrol or diesel price can affect the people in various ways. For example, when the petrol price is raised, many people usually prefer to use public transport. Excess use public transport leads to more traffic jam on roads for hours. This makes people feel uncomfortable as well as late to their works. So, it causes many disadvantages to normal middle class people who tends to use normal vehicles for their daily uses.

In conclusion, by the above aforementioned  points, the rise in fuel rates has various effects on normal people and it is not the best way to solve the environmental pollutions. However, the electric vehicles and growing more trees can solve the majority of the problem. The government should implement new awareness of pollution in schools can also results to decrease environmental problems","**Task Achievement: 6**

Some people believe that the government should not spend money on international aid when they have their own disadvantaged people like homeless and unemployed. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Some individuals suppose that the government should allocate financial resources to other impoverished countries while others believe that it is of paramount importance to focus on solving their domestic issues. From my point of view, I strongly agree with the proposal of determining national priority on internal problems.

On the one hand, it is undeniable that cross-border support is a symbol of humanity. Geographically, people are divided into different ethnicities but by nature, it will be the core of connecting features among individuals. Thus, aiding the poor stems from the consciousness and heart of each resident and is not solely contingent on monetary contributions. Not to mention that helping other nations to encounter  financial crises would eliminate the chances of illegal migration which is detrimental to surrounding developed regions. For example, back to the COVID-19 pandemic, with  assistance from the whole world related to foods, vaccines,... etc, leading to a sustainable society as well as expressing humanity among several nations.

Nevertheless, I am of the opinion that concentrating on addressing domestic issues such as homelessness or unemployment should be of the utmost urgency in any country. To begin with, the financial fund from the government is regarded as a crucial means to reserve and maintain welfare schemes as well as social security. The smooth flow of how society works would generate a favourable environment for employment opportunities which accordingly increases the economic growth rate. Furthermore, employment prospects, consequently, generate more personal budgets which people can use to afford decent accommodation decreasing the homelessness rate.

In conclusion, although transnational support should be executed as a gesture of humanity, I still believe that the government should put the goal of tackling internal issues in a country to be the top priority.","## Task Achievement:

Some people believe that the government should not spend money on international aid when they have their own disadvantaged people like homeless and unemployed. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Over the last 100 years, population has grown at an exponential rate across many countries in the world. This brings along with it its own problems such as poverty, illiteracy, unemployment and so on. Many governments allocate huge resources to tackle these problems. Since all governments have problems to solve in their own countries, I agree with the argument that their first priority should be their own people.

There are ample reasons why I believe that the government should put the welfare of its own people ahead of others. To begin with, financial resources are becoming scarce and many countries are already in debt. These funds must be reserved for the development and maintenance of its own institutions and social security measures such as free health care and shelters for homeless people. Secondly, such welfare schemes not only elevate people out of poverty; they also help the government indirectly by creating jobs. This, in turn, facilitates the economic growth of the country.

On the other hand, it is understandable and reasonable to donate money to the poorer nations as a gesture of basic human decency and humanity. No nation, after all, can live in prosperity when its neighbours are struggling with poverty. By offering financial assistance to their poor neighbours, countries can also put a curb on illegal immigration. Even so, in my opinion, solving problems in one’s own country is more important than venturing to help others. Others should be helped only when the donating country has a surplus of money and resources.

In conclusion, there are obvious benefits for the government in the long run from donating money as relief aids to many foreign countries. However, I strongly iterate that the government must first improve the economic, financial and employment prospects of its own people before embarking on humanitarian work abroad.","## Task Achievement:

"Some people believe that it is the government’s responsibility to provide care and finance to support people after they retire. Others, however, think that individuals themselves should save money in their own when they are old. Discuss both views and give your opinion. > DISCUSS AND OPINION","Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.

It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.

To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.

In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think that the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","These days, some people are assuming that institutions are used for children only purchase to be a good citizens and workers. However, Education can be a most valuable thing for every human being to become a knowledgeable person and use it in so many ways that can give themselves more beneficial than imagine. In this essay, i will discuss both sides of the view and provide my overall opinion.

Generally speaking, there are two main reasons is now believing that it can only use in to be a good person and worklife. Firstly, schools are made for human, where people can taken good things. To be precise, Education gives the real meaning of life what exactly children needs to do in their upcoming times, either they take it or waste their time on wasted area.For example, by taking good morality from schools are able to know what are goods and bads, so they can make difference on that. Secondly, children are going to do hard working to get success. This is because, if children wants to live a better life then have to do as much hard work they didn't. Proof themselves as a best workers in their corporate life, so that they can chance to enhance their position and salary.

On the other hand, there is a case for the idea that not only help on those areas but also children are going to fullfil their uncomplete wishes that they hadn't got in their child age. Unlike in the past, children are now getting access all of the facilities they want, so they can use their didactic knowledge with that resourses are going to build something that can produce best outcome for them and world as well.In addtion, children who are gifted they can be a businessman, show some creativity in their little life to become more polpular or be a sucessfull person.

"Some people think that the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather than to benefit them as individuals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Some people are of the opinion that the primary role of schools is to create good citizens, instead of merely working towards individual betterment. During the course of this essay, this statement would be subjected to objective discussion before drawing a rational conclusion. 

Obviously, there are a plethora of reasons to support the given perspective; nevertheless, the value of a well-functioning society seems to be the most widely accepted. As contemporary society moves into a phase of rapid developments in medicine, technology, welfare and so on, the luxury of conformity requires people to sacrifice their individualism for common prosperity.  To be specific, individuals are expected to function harmoniously to both stimulate the economy and preserve the peaceful existence amongst communities. As much as these prerequisites require education, school is where this education can initiate. In many educational institutions, teachers have the power to both openly and subconsciously influence students’ socially responsible actions and provide them with a solid foundation for future employment.

On the other hand, this perspective should not be considered an ideal one. As a result of following their own ostensibly selfish goals, students who are taught to share, work effectively in teams, and enhance their talents can benefit society. In addition, it’s possible that occasionally the emphasis on society may come at the expense of people’s mental health. For instance, pupils who are instructed to keep their personal opinions to themselves in class, as is typical in many authoritarian countries, could harbour anger and feel unable to properly express themselves in a democratic setting. According to cognitive science, the ability to express oneself without worrying about negative consequences or repercussions is essential for well-rounded development.

In conclusion, while there is a case to be made for societal stability, schools should work to develop strong, motivated students. Naturally, these objectives do not conflict with one another, and it is important to highlight the overlap.","### Task Achievement: **7**

"Some people think the main purpose of school is to turn children into good citizens and workers, rather than to benefit them as individuals.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The young generation of each country is its main part contributing to the future of that country. Schools as the second home of children have a significant role in their lives; as a result, there is a widely accepted belief which says they are only responsible to provide the future law-abiding citizens and productive workers. On the contrary, there is another hypothesis against that which points out that schools should concentrate on students' happiness and personal growth regardless of the society and professional market requirements. I believe to some extent both ideas are correct and the right way is to utilize both ideas at the same time.

On the one hand, a proportion of people agree schools have to provide both educational and vocational curricula for students to provide the nation with citizens who will behave based on the predefined rules and act proactively in the industry as employees. For example, these days, elementary school pupils are encouraged to join different extra-time classes including sports, dance, science or vocational.

On the other hand, there is an idea against the aforementioned belief which says if kids require to know their mental and physical characteristics first, then they will figure out their talents easily. This idea points  out that playtime is a must-have for children at school and they need to play with other counterparts in school to learn the concept of teamwork naturally. Therefore, they will learn to obey the law and be productive by doing social activities.

In general, there are two hypotheses about the responsibility of schools to nurture students. The first one knows schools are responsible for preparing useful employees and citizens, but the second one mentions children only need to take benefits from schools individually. Although schools have to focus on the personal growth of each child, they need to prepare them for their future professional life as children are the most valuable asset of each nation.","**Task Achievement:**

I agree with this statement because  seminary institutions  teach good qualities and skills that are important for offspring today. I will give some of my opinions which I will explain in this essay

firstly, young generations learn good habits and skills at faculty. the teacher trains each junior to follow the routine and makes the scholar a disciplined and organized person. in addition, the moral values that are taught at hall bring up the heir of the best quality. Maravich department plays a very important role in the upbringing of scion a. for example, r9m during the lesson, many practical lessons are given that are related to the psychology of the graduate to them they are given a task, for example, to choose bad or good what is right or wrong. Today, many schools focus on certain subjects that may help an undergraduate's future career instead of spending too much time on extra subjects for sports or extracurricular activities. 

Secondly , the priority task for the academy is to teach the rules а. of civil behaviour. as a result, it will help to reduce the number of crimes and accidents that occur in the country and maintain discipline among residents. they still have to teach them to follow the rules of aesthetics and, of course, the law of the country and religion. for example, today the most developed countries, this factor is a vulnerable place for them in many cases, many citizens of these countries do not follow the rules and do not maintain discipline. this can be seen in the following situations such as garbage in the streets unclean condition of public transport and in many cases violation of traffic rules and environmental pollution. my opinion is that only an institution can effectively educate these qualities of a nation that offspring from different ages were taught these positive qualities.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Schools are known as the the first place of learning for the child. Every person has it's own way of thinking to some extent regarding the schools. Few people thinks that the main purpose of school is to turn children into good citizens and workers ,rather to benefit them as aindividuals.
In the present era, when childrens are at home they usually, indulge themseves in playing with different gadgets and the most favourite gadget for them is video game and mobile.

I totally disagree with the above statement because  acc to my thinking schools plays an important role in shaping up the behaviour of a child and make the child a responsible and successful in his life. It benefited a lot to them as an individual. Personality and behaviour are only the two things which shape up the future of the child and he become a good human beings. He learnt the good values from the school only. Qualities like honesty,sharing and caring all get from the school.'School 'is atemple for child where he get the positive vibrations all the time. Positivity in the life of a child is very important than only he becomes successful.

From the above points, I concluded that school is the only place where a child shape up his career ,become  a good citizen and moreover, child become a good human being. For the betterment of the society we need good people having good values among them.","### Task Achievement:

"2) Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Teenager is a very active phase of life when they have so much curiosity to explore about the world.  In order to utilize that energy in a positive way, I do believe that they need to be involved in a social work as a volunteered. This will help for a community as well as teenagers themselves as it will give them a kind of sense of being worthwhile in a society. Moreover, it is obvious that community will get benefit from it as it will help to build harmonious society.  

There are three reasons why I recommend to include teenagers in unpaid social work. Firstly, when teenagers start working in the community from the early age of their life, they will learn different life skills which will be useful for them in the future. Furthermore, it will help them to gain work experience which will make their life easy to find the job in their adulthood. Moreover, teenagers will feel the sense of being included and being part of the society which help them to grow mentally and physically. Thus, I strongly support to involve teenager in social activities. 

Secondly, encouraging teenagers in social work will help to lower the risk of them getting involved in illegal activities. As teenagers are very curious by the nature to see the world and they can easily influences by other as their articulative ability to distinguise right and wrong is not fully develop, they might choose the wrong way during this stage of life. Therefore, keeping them busy in community work in their free time will help to distract them from making the bad decision in their life. 

Thirdly, involving teenagers in a community volunteer work will set an example for others to be selfless and help each other. Moreover, it will help to build a peaceful, harmonious and cooperative environment in the community. In addition, observeing teenager doing the social work will encourage others to do the volunteer work in future. Furhtermore, teenagers will feel empower, proud and confident being part of the society and being able to bring the change in the community.

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"having the opportunity to work at a young age is very beneficial in the future. many people think youngsters should do unpaid jobs, hence this leads to more benefits for teenagers and the community. which to some extent I disagree with this belief.

firstly , expecting the young population to do the unpaid tasks is unthoughtful , for instance, these days because of school they already have enough tasks to do that they barely have free time , so imagine making them  do unpaid jobs at those limited times . as a result, many of them might lose themselves to this amount of pressure.

on the other hand , working at these ages can improve many skills in them which they can use in their future ,also it can teach them how can a workplace be and how should they behave and perform with other people. moreover , these works give benefits to the society and the community in which they live and improve the quality of their neighborhood .in addition working without expecting to get money can make them understand doing some tasks is just for a better feeling and not for the money can opens their eye to immaterial world and changes the way they’re viewing the world. 

to sum up , there are many benefits to this work but it shouldn’t be forced on teenagers because not every person's situation is the same. but it also can be useful for the community that they live in  raise the quality of their life and make changes in many things.","**Task Achievement:**

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree.,"It is argued that unpaid community can develop student's behavior to keeping up their productivity. I agree with this view because voluntary jobs can help teenagers to learn how maintain their time management and also learn how to be a good communicator in the future.

Time management is the important things for students before they will become adults. . For example, when people are working in a company which prodives services, if they were not be able to make a better preparation, the customers would be angry with their services because of the unhurried and delayed performance. People who have a good management can easily to complete their daily task in schedule, especially in the future when they will be having some unpredictable situations that make them to behave wisely and responsibility.

Communication is one of the important skills to deliver the information and reaching some audiences. For example, In private company, employee who can not speak calmly with their colleagues are tended to be shifted in other departments, because they are more likely offended or angried when receive some critics from their employers. When people working in the society, they can not choose with the who that they are likely to work, so that they have to be ready worked with the oldest group of the people.

In conclusion, I believe that unpaid community gives beneficial experience for teenagers to be productive, the teenagers not only have an insightful experience, such as how to be wisely to manage their time, but they also learn how to be a good speaker who can control the conversation go smoothly.","**Task Achievement:**

In my opinion, This can not be acceptable for youngsters who attempt to live on their own. This essay partially agree with this topic and will discuss both views

On the one hand, It can reduce an expenditure of community organization who works for public without paid as well as it also can contribute youngsters to gain essential skill and social skill which could help them to grow up effectively and can face to a real world.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There are a lot of young people who go to do unpaid community work after school. Some people think that it is good for both young people and the community. My view is that unpaid community jobs can provide teenagers and the community with a lot of advantages. 

 

First, it is obvious that young people can have a good experience for doing community work. This is because they need to learn how to communicate with different kinds of people who are living in this community and how to work together. So they can learn something different that is not from books. 

 

Moreover, young people can build a good relationship with other people. For example, young people can meet with other people who are in the similar age and they can make friends easier after working together. Therefore, young people should have more friends in the same area and have a better memory. 

 

On the other hand, the government can save money for the community because young people can do some community job for free. For instance, teenagers can clean the community’s park regularly, so that the government can spend less money on it. Moreover, the government can use that money to organize some activities for public.

"Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid
work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this
would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole.
Do you agree or disagree?","Many youngsters work on a volunteer basis, and this can truly be conducive for both the community and themself; however, from my perspective, I disagree with the viewpoint that all teenagers should be forced to do unpaid work in their leisure time.

One evident reason that supports my idea is that students are already stressed and tired enough during their school hours; therefore , they should be allowed to rest and enjoy their leisure time in lieu of being asked to do unpaid work. Forcing students to do such work might further enhance their burden and even lead to a reduction in their academic performance. Another problem is that inefficient work can be anticipated. To exemplify, It can be easily envisaged that people who are compelled to do work  against their will are liable to end up inefficiently; moreover, this action can even exacerbate the relationship between the adolescents and the local community, eventually reaching the outcome which is against the initial expectation.

People who stand on the opposite side might contend that youngsters can cultivate a sense of responsibility through work on a volunteer basis. This can be sensible in some aspects; however, except for being forced to do unpaid work, there are still other gateways for the young to attain the same effect. For example, it is also an act of responsibility for some teenagers who manage their own time to do part-time jobs to support their tuition or personal expenses and ameliorate their families' economical condition. 

In conclusion, I disagree with the view that young people should be required to do unpaid work as many drawbacks can be anticipated. The meaning of volunteer work would be conducive for both sides only if it is not against any individual’s will.","**Task Achievement:**

It is the community's intention to provide an opportunity to learn time management as well as various experiences, such as how to communicate with diverse people, compassion for one another, and unity to work well together, which are essential parts of becoming a reasonable person. In this regard, if a teenager adds infomation on their charity work in their leisure time, it will improve their portfolio and make it easier to apply to a famous university in the future. In addition, the community will get quality citizens.

Futhermore, the teens will have connections with people who work in highly reputable companies, which can help the youngster by providing reference and assiting in the search for na prestigious job. Moreover, adolescents who volunteer with a variety of organizations will aid in the discovery of their goals and the development of path toachieve them because many of these organizations will teach valuable lessons, and then their parrents will be proud of them.

Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?,"Numerous young people are involved to work on a volunteer basis. Society thinks that they gain experience for free and should not get any income as they improve their local community. In this essay, I will argue this statement.

Every job, despite its usefulness, must be paid. We have to encourage teenagers by any means for their efforts to develop a productive and prosperous community. In my residential complex, for instance, children receive a discount coupon for a candy shop if they do public work like helping to restore a sporting area or cleaning common spaces. If they were made to work for free, they would not complete all requirements in the best way they can.

Another major reason is that teenagers should spend their spare time for education. We can consider that not only regular school or university visits, but also completing homework are teenagers' duties. It is not arguable that if students have been spending more time learning rather than working, they will grow up to be well-educated and qualified specials. If all my former classmates had studied instead of working, we would have had more benefits to build a wealthy city.

In conclusion, it is up to young people to decide how they would like to be useful for a community, volunteer for free, or study hard to get a degree. I think we have to teach children from the very first step that nothing in the world is for free and they have paid their own leisure time in order to get money or other items they want.","**Task Achievement:**

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is debatable that teens should volunteer during their leisure time. Due to the fact, that volunteering can benefit both teenagers and society. I completely agree with the above statement so I will explain my opinion using examples from the United Kingdom and Sri Lanka. 

Youngsters´ participation in unpaid work influences them positively. I will begin with that involving teenagers in volunteering activities converts them to be good-oriented adults in the future. In addition, taking responsibility for these kinds of helping works capable to teach many qualifications, for instance, leadership, task performance, and being more disciplined. As an example, During the UK school children’s gap year, they often volunteer to take after the elderly who need help. Also, Research confirmed the immense impacts of this on improving the participated candidates’ kindness, caring, patience and humility. 

Moreover, teenagers’ volunteer work can empower the development of the communities. Because of having busy teens will end up reducing the number of crimes, robberies, unethical involvements, and sexual harassment. As a piece of evidence, in 2000, criminal activities and rape cases went down immensely, subsequently, after adopting the idea of encouraging Sri Lanka 10-grade- school students to volunteer throughout summer vacation.

In conclusion, it is crystal clear that teenagers’ involvement in unpaid work positively affects them and the community as well. Teenagers often enrich their qualities and experience because of taking part in the volunteer industry. I couldn’t be more agreeable, as I believe that adolescents should participate in different community activities to build their confidence, hence being productive individuals in society.","### Task Achievement:

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is not unusually to see young people are mandatory for doing housework. Some have argued that the youngers doing work in the association for free in their free time can have advantages both for the community and teenagers. Personally, I completely agree. In this essay, I will explain why this initiative will benefit teenagers and the neighbourhood.

The main reason why the younger should do unpaid community work is that teenagers can have a healthy lifestyle. There is no doubt that young students spending much free time gaming or studying means less time for exercise, and a much more sedentary lifestyle, which can result in chronic diseases such as obesity, heart disease and diabetes. Students will have more opportunities to exercise instead of watching TV or playing video games, for instance, if those works are mandatory for them. The healthier life youngers have, the more chances to do what they want.

In addition, in terms of association, this behaviour will save a lot of money. The neighbourhood does not need to hire more staff because there are lots of youngers doing work for free. For example,  Teenagers can do some easy work such as cleaning and helping old people, which will cost a lot of budgets. Every dollar that can be saved on hiring staff can be invested in infrastructure, which can increase the well-being of habitats. Clearly, this initiative will be a benefit to the association in the long run.

In conclusion, I do believe that compulsory works have many advantages, not only for the younger physically healthy  but also for the development of the community.","**Task Achievement: 8**

Do you agree or disagree?,"Several people believe that if children work in their free time to support the local country, they would be paid a salary for their work. This brings a lot of advantages for both the young people and the community. I completely disagree with this idea. 

Firstly, children could lose time to other activities when they have leisure after scheduling at school. Younger people have to spend time studying from Monday to Friday, and they have weekends to help them relax after learning at school. For example, all the young people usually play games, soccer, and so on with their family and friend. 

Secondly, younger people tend to particular into experience programs with the method of volunteer. There are many jobs to help other people in society. Moreover, young people participate in volunteer programs to help people who have poorer circumstances without needing any fee. To illustrate, charity programs about kids and older people who have difficult statements attract a lot of teenagers, besides they are also plenty of benefits. 

Finally, teenagers are encouraged to help their families on the weekends. There are some weak jobs in housing that they could make when they have free time. For instance, one of the most popular housework that youngers could make is that cleaning, growing plants, and so on because those works are suitable for them.

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent to do agree or disagree?,"Our teenagers nowadays seem to be unresponsible towards their society as they have been occupied by social media feeds. Hence, this is a suggestion to engage them in voluntary jobs to aid their community and improve their skills at the same time. In my perspective, this step could be beneficial for both the nation and adolescent as it will improve his responsibility and his interpersonal skills which could be a life-changer for our offspring.

  As a starting point, when a teenage boy provides services for the elderly for instance, he will appreciate his life in addition to this rewarding satisfaction of helping others. Consequently, this experience will improve his character and will make him willing to help the underprivileged people in his society. Furthermore, this trend will make the children more introverted and interact with their peers to reach  ingenious solutions to the problems which their countries suffer from.

  On the other hand, this voluntary work will teach a valuable lesson to our generation about their duty in their surroundings and will strengthen the bond with the nation. Certainly, when the child will feel that he makes a difference in his community, he will improve this sense of nationality simultaneously. As a consequence, the new generations will be capable of dealing with the emerging obstacles in their countries.

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Teenagers can learn a lot through working in the community in their free time. Many people believe that this can be advantageous to the community and the children because services like picking up garbage and helping elders can teach teenagers to keep the place clean and tidy and respect their elders. I believe, however, that they should be paid for their work and time rather than doing it for free. 

Children do have free time compared to adults. It can motivate them to participate in these activities, utilized time appropriately, and get paid.  In other words, knowing that they will earn through their hard work without even pushing them, they will participate voluntarily. For instance, if a teenager wants to buy pair of sports shoes, he will work in the community and earn that money rather than asking his parents. However, if asked to work for free, they might end up not performing the tasks well. They will find reasons to avoid performing services to the community. When forced to do the job, the outcome might turn out to be poor. For example, when rewarded, the child will be willing to do duty with utmost care. Therefore, it should be compulsory to pay, when they are working in their leisure time.

In conclusion, the community should pay children for working because it will motivate them. In addition, there would not be any need to force them because they will voluntarily participate considering the reward they will earn.","**Task Achievement:**

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Volunteering helps in various aspects, some argue that teenagers must do volunteering in their free time and that it is beneficial to both the teenagers and their communities. in my opinion i agree, for a couple of reasons that i shall discuss.

unpaid community work can be helpful to teenagers, through enabling them to learn new skills, be exposed to working environment, develop their personality and perhaps even make a career choice. although, they might complain, utilizing free time to actually be useful grants a sense of accomplishment. furthermore by filling free time with serving the society, this closes the door on harmful activities, which teenagers are the most prone to, such as crime and illicit drug addiction.

similarly, volunteering has positive effects on communities. In regards to city budget, and resources as well as the public image (for example : cleaning beaches). as well as the additive effects of decreasing crime rates and addiction. the regular activity of volunteering makes a healthy community, that is active, and stable.

Some people believe that teenagers should be required to do unpaid community work in their free time. This can benefit teenagers and the community as well. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"One might think that enforcement of mandatory community service by youths during their free hours will be beneficial to them and the community. I highly disagree with this opinion, because teenagers have the right to choose which skill they want to progress in their free time. In addition to that, community development is the responsibility of the government.

Freedom to select what interesting thing to do on the youths precious time can further motivate them to excel. This is because every person is unique and has various points of preference. It drives them to invest time and focus in achieving certain tasks. A better approach is to present the tasks and programs that can help them hone their present skills. For example youths with anti-social behaviour, it will be unfair for them to be required to work in a community that requires social skills. Anti-social presons can be productive in solitary jobs like computer programming.

Obviously, teenagers development through forced labor in the community will never be productive for them. Since this is carried out in a way that youths dont have a choice, results are expected to be in low compliance. Only a low percentage of this age-group can tolerate uncompensated labor, most of them spends their time in social gatherings, games and even sports. In contrast, youths who work usually would expect to have salaries, as this will be the motivating factor for them to buy their needs and wants at this stage in life. As an example, nowadays, highschoolers are active with social media, they spent a huge number of hours on these platforms, learning, communicating, and at times take advantage to earn extra money, that is why community work will be the least option for them.  

In conclusion, there are much better alternatives in honing the youth, among those options, community required jobs are not the best. Teenagers can be productive and beneficial to the community by doing things where they excel and enjoy the most.","**Task Achievement:** [6]

"Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole.
Do you agree or disagree?","Nowadays, there are many people who believe that all teenagers have to take apart in the summer camp for their spare time which can be helpful for their society. They also feel that in general, these materials have played a crucial role on their personality. Despite of this idea, I personally disagree with this notion, hence reasons will be analysed in this article.

In my opinion, it could be a misconception about students and teenagers which are obliged to do an an unpaid job in the summer. First of all, they should have the opportunity to do whatever they want in life. However, if they forced, it may affect on the outcome of their job, because they have done something which they are not eager to do it. Secondly, when students and teenagers attend to school, they have a hectic curriculum which means they do not have adequate time to refresh their mind and peruse on their interest hobbies. Finally, with these situations, if we force them, we will kill their free time.

My idea varies widely with this notion which these obligations would be beneficial both for teenagers and their community. Firstly, by following their ideas, students are forced to do things that are against their will. So as a result, they cannot do their best in their work and after a while they will figure out that they have just wasted their time by doing these unpaid jobs. Therefore, it would not have an impact on their personality. In addition, if they are forced, we will increase the number of people who are depressed or have a lot of problems in their lives. For instance, some researches on some students in the UK indicate that those students which had gone to the summer camp, had a number of issues related to their society after that work.

In conclusion, while teenagers may choose to work for free in their spare time, I believe that we should not make this compulsory.","**Task Achievement: 7**

They believe this would be benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree ?,"In some countries, many more people don't encourage teenagers to work without paying in their free time. However, some people believe that do unpaid work to help teenagers to investigate cognitive development. And I completely agree with this idea. They can get value experiences through social activity. 
On the one hand, doing jobs during in teenager's free date in an advanced age, they can learn a lot of things in life. For themselves, they will spend more occasion at work, and limit free moment to do useless things. There are large universities such as Havard and Stanford besides of academic criteria also add social criteria and this is a big advantage for those who want to be accepted into one of famous schools.  
For example: In addition to school knowledge, they can learn many things from the neighbourhood. They will increase the ability to communicate with people,  also help improve teamwork skills and can arrange the best time. While such things are great, it should be considered whether they affect learning or not.  
On the other hand, this is a force that can help the district in volunteer activities. It will help the new generation pay more attention to everyone around and provide more labour resources for society. For instance, at festivals or finding volunteers to help elderly or to scavenge around the area where they live or teach the local language for foreigners. Nevertheless, even though this is a young labour force, they are still in their teens. It's better to find age-appropriate chores.  
In conclusion, I suppose the experiencing jobs in leisure time is more beneficial for adolescents. I think the family and society need to create conditions for children to develop according to their abilities.","**Task Achievement: 6.5**

"Some people think that all teenagers should be required to do unpaid work in their free 
time to help the local community. They believe this would benefit both the individual 
teenager and society as a whole.
Do you agree or disagree?","There is an increasingly growing popular belief that young people should be forced to take part in volunteer activities to contribute to the society in their spare time. While I agree with the thought that it is beneficial to both students and the public, I believe that youngsters should not be obliged to do community service without being paid.

On the one hand, there are several benefits of giving young students the added responsibility of doing unpaid work. Firstly, by doing these works, teenagers can accumulate valuable experiences and essential skills for their future career. In addition, they will be given the opportunity to have better resumes, which is useful once they start pursuing higher education or seeking jobs. Finally, the public also benefits from this group of people as they help to finish the necessary work.

On the other hand, I disagree with the idea that serving the community without any financial incentive should be voluntary. One reason is that the amount of work that needs to be done at school is already enormous. Children nowadays are forced to attend several cram schools and extra classes, which, according to numerous parents, will help them to obtain better academic results. Another important factor is that youngsters need sometimes for themselves to develop their own interests, make some new friends or take up new sports.

In conclusion, although I accept that doing community service without payment is advantageous to both the society and students individually, I do not consider the idea that it should be made compulsory.","**Task Achievement:**

To begin with, catalyst is a key factor that enables staff to do well in their duties and having a 4-week break annually definitely helps.

This essay will explain further.

Job satisfaction is the main responsibility of the Human Resource department in any industry and business and a lack of  this area will end up when an employee leaves the company. hence, the employee can be happy and satisfied with work for many reasons, for instance, financial income, reward program, career development and benefits,  we can say that there can be some career goals which compel people to stay in the work market and even make them stay work late hours. Professionals don't leave their jobs so that they can get more and more work experience and be awarded promotions and certain desired positions in long run. Even women are also in this race and not ready to compromise their careers on the family because they also have the motives of getting  managerial positions. Besides this, the masses work to get job benefits, for instance, insurance and free vacations with family to Europe and other fascinating destinations. 

In addition to this, on 2017 Hilti company hired an external agent to make a survey for their employees about major issues that affect performance as well as how much they believe in long service in the company, the results were surprising  90% of the employees are searching for another opportunity outside due to money, hence, this made the management to take serious actions, for example, salary review and set the salary benchmark against market standards. moreover, many researchers have done about employee satisfaction through recruiter agencies and institutes found out that 70% of employees can be productive at work when they are well paid and their income is enough to cover their daily expenses.

In conclusion, money is a very important factor for employees to be productive and stay in the company, hence companies should take serious actions for this reason, such as yearly review of the salary and ensure employees are well paid by adding a bonus system for a productive employee or achieving the targets or else the company will face serious issues on employee retention as well as, company performance.","**Task Achievement: 7**

"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people, while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate. Discuss both views and give you own opinion","Every person has different beliefs about a purpose of museums. The majority of people believe that museums should be visited as an entertainment while others think that this place is to educate. In my opinion, I see museums as a place where people can do both fun and get knowledge.

On the one hand, not everyone in this world enjoy visiting a monument because most of the people are not really interested in history or geography. Furthermore, they will be bored if there is no something funny to see. For instance, research reveals that more than 30% of teenagers that went to museums felt no enjoyable. Some of them even wanted to go home earlier. As a result, a function of museums should be added more to be entertain.

On the other hand, generally, museums are related to history, and some of them contain many ancient artefacts and weapons. This purpose is to give public new knowledge about our past conditions or how our heroes sacrificed themselves. For example, in Yogyakarta, there is a house that constructed into a museum that show Indonesian history. Because of this, tourists and visitors can see real-life example of a country history, and they can get education that they can not get in schools.

In conclusion, although a function of museums is to educate people, it is not wrong to turn museums into entertainment places.","**Task Achievement:**

"Some people think that museums should be enjoyable places to entertain people,
while others believe that the purpose of museums is to educate.
Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","These days, public debate has been going on over whether museums should amuse or enlighten humans. Both viewpoints can be grounded with compelling arguments, which are key for understanding the reasons behind conflict and can broaden one’s horizons, therefore, will be analyzed.

To embark on, a pleasurable experiences in museums would have a range of benefits for the society. To start with, a higher attendance of the institutions would be provoked. For this reason, more tickets would be bought and higher sums of money collected. The financial savings could be used for virtuous purposes when, for example, state museums would give them to the government. The latter undeniably has a dozen of opportunities for investment, including social projects that increase the welfare of the country. Moreover, some museums might become a cheap option for entertainment. If more people can afford the latter, they will have more opportunities for unwinding themselves. Undoubtedly, relaxing and resting after a workday is indispensable for being productive the next day. Eventually, workers could produce more value for their land or environment with their work. 

	But the assertion that museums should serve the purpose of teaching people, has convincing justifications too. One of them is that the facilities could evoke curiosity about the culture along with traditions of a land. This may catalyze the development of national pride and patriotism. Consequently, individuals pursuing such values would get motivated and have an incentive to collaborate, work hard for the nations well-being and promote peace in their surroundings for achieving that. Furthermore, expositions might spark curiosity about some subjects. As a result, there would be more young personas inspired about science, hence, interested in studying. If they learned more, they would acquire more skills for possibly inventing something in the future. If it would turn out to be so, the inventions could help the society like electricity does.

	This leads to the conclusion that making museums a place, which is fun to come to, and utilizing them for enlightening members of the society has a multitude of merits. On the basis of the above discussion it might not be clear for what one should opt for, however, it may be manageable somehow for museums to fulfill both needs and solutions for that should be sought after.","**Task Achievement:**

Some think that they should be  a place for enjoyment, while the others are certain, that it is important for them to be educational.  In this essay I will discuss both views and state my opinion.

Nevertheless, museums are tourist attractions  and attract many visitors in general, so big part of society thinks, that they should emphasize the  enjoyment, create more interactive activities or some sort of games, so that the exhibitions could be  more entertaining for people of all ages and that way more people would take interest in visiting  places like that.  On the other hand, a big part of the society believes that not everything in this world should be all  about fun and games. They are sure that the main point of any exhibition is to help people learn  about something they did not know previously. This means that the story behind every exhibit  should be explained, and this can be done in various ways. Some museums have professional guides,  and the others offer audio guides, so that the visitors can listen to a commentary about every single  object and explore them by themselves. That way people do not have to read long and boring  descriptions and then museums can play a big part in helping people broaden their knowledge in  many different aspects of life.

To commence with the initial view that why art galleries should be a place of entertainment the people act as a stress buster. In other words, In this fast-paced era, the Majority of the masses do work or study which not only lead to franchised scheduler but also deprives them to provide relief to their minds.

Museums can be used to attract tourists which will benefit the country in the end as it can flourish the economy. In contrast, museums are imperative to educate the public about their art, history and culture. In my opinion, museums should be used for both educational and entertainment purposes.

To begin with, museums attract numerous tourists from all around the globe. From an economic perspective, museums generate job opportunities in the market and contribute to the growth of the local economy because of tourists, which will benefit the nation in the end. A museum where people could enjoy and entertain attracts more people than other museums. There are museums where it is not only about history or art, such as the kimchi museum in South Korea and the chocolate museum in Belgium. Hence, since these museums are quite popular among international tourists, museums should be a place to entertain people. 

On the contrary, museums play a crucial role in educating the public about art, history, science, culture among others. Moreover, it is imperative for educating future generations about their history, culture and roots. Thus, museums are undoubtedly a huge source of knowledge, so it ought to be solely used for educational purposes.

There are various reasons why I support the above-stated viewpoint. First and foremost, being attractive far more  citizens will visit them, especially the youngest. In other ,words the view of entertaining areas convinces all of them in contrast, an old-fashioned museum. A striking example is the new three dimensional films which are watched by visitors in the new Acropolis museum in Athens.

This can be offered by inserting new technologies in the institution such as games, painting and other activities. The above can be illustrated by the 

I strongly disagree with those holding the view that institution exists only for educational purpose. To begin with, they consider that museums are built for completing the schools' courses.

Opinions differ as to whether the role of museums is solely limited to entertain us or as a means of education. In this essay, I will not only discuss both sides, but also provide my viewpoint while concluding this.

To begin with, these galleries serve people in getting rid of their boredom. To elaborate, nowadays, people tend to get tired very easily, owing to their monotonous lifestyles. In order to mitigate this weariness, these archaeological places can serve as a one of the many options for them to explore and rejuvenate.

 Red Fort, for instance, is frequently visited by tourists and local people as a leisure activity.

Conversely, these museums are the symbol of our cultural history, identity, and traditions. Visiting these places helps people to broaden their horizon and enhance their knowledge about their ancestral roots. According to an article published in ""THE TIMES"", the students who explored these sites as their history assignment, achieved more success than other students in their exams. Besides this, feeling proud about their identity is an another possible reason. Because of the globalisation the world has become a smaller place, these places serves as a medium to connect people to their traditional roots,and also develop a social bond between them. As a result, they are proud of their national identities and its values.

To conclude, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe museums have an equally important role to serve as a leisure activity as well as for education, and people have sole right to decide upon what they want to do.","**Task Achievement:**

For my perspective, both of distraction and education sides shoud be encouraged in museums.
On the one hand, museums should be play in the entertainment role for some reasons. Firstly, lots of people are likely to go somewhere in weekends to let their hair down after hard working days. They want to look for a transquil place to contemplate the beauty of life or artworks and museums are such appropriate sites. Secondly, museums are destinations for tourist attractions, where a country may advertise its regional or national culture or history. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate the interacted activities or funny games into museum trips so that visitors do not feel boring and find it easy to remember the knowledge provided by the guides. 
On the other hand, museums should teach people about many aspect of life, such as history, science, art, culture and so on. Almost every city in one country possess at least one museum to serve local people and tourists. Hence, professional guides of museums have to either explain visitors whatever about the historical stories or origin of relics attached to locality or distribute to visitors pictures or audio documentary so that they understand well about details of one exhibition. Schools and colleges also usually organise museum trips where pupils or students are more eager to learn or verify the reality through visual sightseeings.

"As society changes, more and more people do not want to stay in one career or job. Many people change their careers and jobs. What is the cause of this phenomenon? Can you give some suggestions to solve this problem?","With the development of our society, there is a noteworthy phenomenon that more and more people do not stay in one job position in all their careers, which means people now change their job frequently. This essay will give several factors that why this happened and will give some suggestions to solve this problem.

The first reason why people changed their job frequently is due to the job market nowadays is much better than it was in the past. Now, there are more jobs for people to choose from in the job market than in the old times. So people will have more chances to join  a new position in the same field or switch to a completely new field due to  society's development.

The second reason is that the cost for people to live  a decent life costs much more than it  used to. So people always want their salary incremented each year. The best way to achieve this is to switch their job to a different company. That's the second reason why employee changed their jobs 

frequently.

The third factor is that the employee are easier to get bored with what they have done in the company, and thanks to the development of the internet. People have a way to find what they are interested in and the internet helps people  learn new knowledge or technology easily. It provides a convenient way for people to switch their jobs. It also causes people  not to stay in one position for a long time.

But this phenomenon may do a little harm to the company because it may lose some expertise employees and if they want to hire  new employees with the same quality, it requires them to pay more salaries to them, which may influence the company's development and profits. So there should have some measures to alleviate this phenomenon happened. The company could provide a clear path for employees to get promoted and give some employees who perform well a good bonus. It will  make employees feel safe and satisfied. What's more, a good work-life balance is also a key factor to reduce the leaving rate for employees.","## Task Achievement:

"as transport and accommodation problems are increasing in many cities, some governments are encouraging business to move to rural areas. do you think the advantages outweigh disadvantages?","It is true that the world's largest companies are located in large cities. In the city many people expect to find better employment opportunities, often with bigger, secure companies. as cities become overcrowded, problems relating to housing and transport arise, because of which some people suggest that the larger companies should relocate to the countryside. while this may have some advantages, i firmly believe that the disadvantages would be far more than the advantages. 

It is reasonable to think that moving thousands of employees from large companies out to remote areas would have a positive impact on the overcrowding of some cities. there would be less traffic because of less strain on the services offered by the city-bank, public transportation, restaurants and the like. This would mean a reduction in queues and faster customer service. To add to it, housing would also become affordable. It is generally seen that because of too many people wanting to live in the city, land prices and event rents of houses start touching the sky.

the problem however would be that a dramatic reduction in numbers of people in the cities would mean that many businesses would go broke. Restaurants, cafes and other service areas would suffer tremendously. What would happen is that overcrowding would occur where the new, large organizations relocate. More and more people offering services would spring up- restaurants, shopping centers and other businesses would be needed to serve the increasingly larger numbers of people who moved to the area. in addition, the rural area may not be able to provide the enormous quantities of housing, electricity and raw materials required to run a huge company. 

Furthermore, relocating businesses to rural areas may upset many households. Children also may have to change schools. so It would not be practical to do so. Transport and accommodation problems in cities need to be sorted out by connecting the villages and cities by very efficient public transport, so that people come to work in cities and live in rural areas. Newer businesses should be encouraged to open in the suburbs; the already existing ones should continue to be where they already are. 

To sum up, relocating the companies would assist with the overcrowding problem in some cities. However, a new set of problems would surface, which would be far more than the benefits. Therefore, I reiterate my point that the idea of moving larger corporations out to rural areas would not be beneficial.","## Task Achievement:

"Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","Many people have expressed that a number of reports detailing crime news should be controlled, as they have many negative effects on society. I partly agree with this view.

On the one hand, I believe the bad influences that stem from two main reasons. Firstly, the direct result of crime news with extremely details are to bring victims psychological injury. To pique readers’ interest, the media may use the bloody images and exaggerated language. This reminds me of a school murder that occurred in China.The local media had numerous reports on the atrocious detail of crimes. Repeated reports led the surviving children to recall the exceptionally painful experience. They had to live under an intense psychological pressure. Secondly, too many details in crime news allow people attempting to commit crime to learn the criminal methods and consequently increasing the crime rate. It not only to victim's mental health caused some damage, but also to the whole community to bring about a great potential threat. So the media should not report too many details of crimes to the public. 

On the other hand, the crime news can serve as a public warning. People can enhance their guarding consciousness in order to avoid becoming a victim, and also  assist the police in remaining alert. For example, the media report criminal news in a public place to arouse our social concern. The police can use this information to strengthen the force of supervision in this areas.

In conclusion, I argue that detail of crimes in the media are likely to invite various problems, and we should limit them to protect people from harm.","## Task Achievement:

"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life.

Moreover, they may only send children at 3-8 years to co-educating schools to improve their skills of the way to respect girls and behave with them in the future. 

Firstly, Some Fathers and mothers have their reasons to choose isolated-gender-school. it could be also related to their beliefs and they want for them a good life when they get older, so they can have their partner and make families. Likewise, send kids in unisex school could be risky which young boy may have a physical relationship with a classmate and get pregnant.

"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life.
Do you agree or disagree?","Today's both single-sex 

In conclusion, 

institutions and co-educational institutions are available to provide education in many nations. Parents, accordingly, can opt for any of these academies for their offsprings to study. While some individuals advocate children who have schooling from single-sex schools face difficulties in later life, I disagree with this notion as students who study in single-sex schools have the same education as co-educational institutions provide to their scholars ,and they have interaction with other sexes after school hours, so it does not have any effect on their later life. 

In terms of education, both single-sex and co-educational academies provide a similar level of education to their students, which means opting for single-sex institutions does not have any effect on students' studies. In other words, the same school subjects are taught in both institutions, so whether to study in a single-sex or co-educational institute does not make any difference in academic studies. Single-sex school students, for example, study the same subjects, such as science, English and maths. Students, therefore, who study in single-sex have the same level of opportunities as co-educational scholars have.

Another point to consider is that interacting with other genders after school times creates no difference between a co-educational and single-sex student. This means that single-sex school students still have interaction with other genders after getting free from  school.

In conclusion, obtaining education from a co-educational or single-sex school does not make in difference in a individual's life.","**Task Achievement:**

"In many countries today, parents are able to choose to send their children to single-sex schools or co-educational schools. Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?","Nowadays, parents have the options of sending their children to single-sex schools or mixed schools and it is thought that children attending single-sex schools will face some problems in the future.In my opinion, I completely agree with this point of view.It is obviously that children going to single-sex schools will not only lose out on communication skills with other gender but also the ability to consider something from different angles when they grow up.
 Firstly, students who learning in gender specific schools have fewer interactions with the opposite sexuality.This can be a challenge for them in their future because they will definitely have to work in a unisexual working environment where teamwork with people of the opposite gender is indispensable.Furthermore, it would have a negative impact on their performance as well as that of others since they are lack of experience of understanding and interacting with the other gender.Moreover, co-ed schools help to reduce the prejudice against the opposite sex because boys will find that a girl can be as brave as any boy and that gossiping is also common among boys.
 Secondly, co-educational school is beneficial for children as they expose them to different viewpoints.Since male and female have varied perspectives on issues and it results in the difference of handling scenarios.Co-education allows children to have opportunities to be involved in and gain an understanding of the opposite gender's opinions.For example, it was statistically proven in an educational journal in Nigeria in 2012 that most versatile youth in their respective places of employment are products of the mixed gender academy, they also tend to have stable emotions no matter the pressure from the opposite sex.
 In conclusion, even though parents these days tend to send their child to single-sex schools due to the future’s drawbacks of unisexual schools, I believe there is a lot to be gained by enrolling their children in a co-ed school such as improving mutual understanding with their opposite sex counterparts and the faculty of thought and reason.","**Task Achievement: [Band 7]**

Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?","Some countries prefer to single gender school for the education of their pupils. A native of some countries, prefer to send their children to the integrated institutions for their elementary education, because they believe it can affect drastically to their life in the upcoming period. I firmly believe that co-educational institutions are a boon, not only for the healthy future of children, but also for the nation as well.
Firstly, pupils who studied in single sex schools, take huge time to get involved in conversation with the opposite gender, the reason behind is, they never experienced public conversation earlier, therefore, pupils do not feel comfortable to speak publicly and get nervous when they have to ask any question or any favor. Moreover, children who get more comfortable in their own group, sometimes behave in improper way with others as few conversations should remain with close people. Most importantly the context of delivery of words should be accurate and proper; otherwise it could hurt the emotions of others or could leave the person embarrassed. The way of using proper words and gesture could develop by studding together.
Furthermore, students can learn and observe various things from their peer which are having opposite gender by doing healthy competition. This would lead to developing many traits which will enhance their knowledge and experience in a positive way. They will learn the sensitivity of words and acts that is lucrative for their own healthy future. In short, students who studied in co-educational schools are more disciplined and punctual.
In conclusion, students can have many skilled traits by studding together along with students of different age, religion and gender, which is possible by getting enrolled in integrated schools.

"Some people think that the best way to become successful in life is to get a university education, whereas others say this is no longer true. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","Colleges and Universities are a crucial part of ancient history. Education is the right of every citizen of a developed and developing countries. Whereas few people contract this fact and say this is no longer needed at all. In My Opinion, Universities develops  discipline, technical skillset , human behaviour and other important aspects of life in the student which make them  survive financially dependent on society.

Getting seats in supreme colleges is always a nutcracker for every student.The preparation to get admission usually starts at a very early stage. The faculty teaches  niche technical skills from scratch to student so that they learn and discovers new inventions in the society. The more skilled person also becomes financial independent in a family with which he can fulfil his dreams. According to a recent survey, the happiness index of a country is equally proportioned to the literacy rate of the population. Nowadays, Government has opened many schemes which provide scholarship to a student whose family can’t afford education.

On other hand, many people still think education is not a necessity. As Education is becoming expensive in society and job opportunities are very low.

"Some people think that the best way to become successful in life is to get a university education, whereas others say this is no longer true. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","It is considered that having academic degrees from institutions is the best way to achieve goals and obtain more success, while others argue that university degrees are not important things to become successful. In my view, effective educations in universities prepare you for a better future and getting professional qualifications.

To begin with, applying for prestigious establishments can assist citizens to achieve their ambitions and give them the best chances to improve their knowledge. Because  the universities have well-known professors that they have professional experience and can help people to become successful. For example, when people have gone to universities, they have developed their practical skills such as  communication skills, time management and leadership skills and these skills can influence  their future lives. In my opinion, going to top universities provide students with comprehensive educations that we cannot find  in any place. Consequently, becoming more successful in life can result in effective education in universities.

On the other hand, getting experience or doing something you like can help you become professional rather than having academic degrees. Sometimes people pursue their ambitions or learn some skills that they want, and these goals can persuade them to become successful. For instance, C. Ronaldo is  one of the best soccer players in the world that does not have any academic degrees, and just he has endless effort. In my view, however, this statement can be accurate, the best way to become a successful person in your life is high-level education in universities.

In conclusion, getting prestigious establishments is the best way that can assist people to become the professional people in their lives, whereas some others believe that  not more important as experiences and goals. In my opinion, academic educations can cultivate practical skills that obtain more success in our lives.","### Task Achievement: 7.5

"Studies have shown that many criminals have a low level of education. For this reason, some people believe that the best way to reduce crime is to educate people in prison, so that they can get a job when they leave. Do you agree or disagree ?","Most of the criminals are uneducated so some people advise to train and provide them education. They state that this will help them to find a job after they leave prison. I strongly agree with this because this is will help to reduce crimes and help for a better society.

Firstly, the number of crimes will reduce in the near future if criminals are taught during their time in imprisonment. Criminals commit crimes because they are not capable of earning money. To satisfy the basic needs of life, they loot other people. Food and shelter are the basis needs to gratify these needs people commit crimes because they are not able to buy these.

The best way to solve the world's environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In the modern day, numerous people believe that it is more beneficial to increase the price of fuel for all means of transportation to cope with environment-related issues. I argue that although this solution can bring about several benefits, there are various effective methods to resolve this pressing matter.

On the one hand, the increase in electricity prices can contribute to preventing environmental problems on a global scale. One reason for this is that when governments apply higher prices for materials, commuters will consider whether they should drive or not to save their money. If people do not drive regularly, it means that less exhausted fumes are released into the atmosphere. Another thing is that instead of using their cars, people will travel by public transportation, which is environmentally - friendly to the surroundings. This has a great contribution to reducing air pollution, especially the large metropolises.

On the other hand, I firmly believe that there is still a plethora of solutions that help to solve environmental problems more effectively. The first method is that the national authorities all over the world should launch community campaigns to educate citizens about the importance of protecting the surrounding environment. Secondly, it is essential to encourage manufacturers to produce various types of vehicles that release less greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. For example, in Vietnam, some technology companies have come up with electric cars which are no fumes. This product is not only suitable for customer needs but also friendly with surroundings.

In conclusion, for the reasons I have mentioned above, I assume that with the increase in the cost of fuel, the government can apply several measures which are better for both the environment and the benefits of residents.","**Task Achievement:**

"The best way to solve the world’s environmental problems is to increase the
cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles.To what extent do you agree or disagree?","n recent years, some people believe that the government increasing the cost of fuel for vehicles is the primary way to solve the environmental problems, whilst others hold the reverse viewpoint. I disagree with this statement. In this essay, I will explain my viewpoints in detail in the ensuing paragraphs.

To begin with, the front and centre in this favour are that cars are necessary means of tools for commuters due to inconvenient public transport in a rural area.Moreover, it is undeniable that the exhaust gas emitted by the usage of automobiles causes environmental pollution. However, raising money for fuel does not solve the root of the phenomenon. For instance, people need to pay more for fuel in order to get to a specific location, which does not change the probability of use. This indicate that this policy would not improve much environmental issues.

At the other end of the spectrum, transportation indeed plays a vital role in our daily life. Considering  carbon dioxide emission, it is the leading cause of air pollution. Therefore, the government may divert some budget to build more facilities for public transport. On the other hand, if they provide some discounted ride plans for taking ones, it would be a better way to decrease the chance of the use of private vehicles. The monthly pass is a salient example. Based on such compelling evidence, it appears that government incentives may improve air pollution. 

In summary, the growing use of automobiles is an issue that needs to be addressed. It is widely believed that the promotion of public transportation can solve environmental problems nowadays.","### Task Achievement:

The best way to solve world’s environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In the twenty-first century, there are many factors that lead to the environmental problem. Thus, some people suppose that the best way to solve this problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other transportations. As far as I am concerned, I partly disagree with that idea. 

Indeed, the increase of the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles can lead to the reduction of the expenditure. When the cost is more expensive than people’s finances , they have a tendency to find other fuels that are affordable. As a result, this restricts the pollution of fuel for transportations such as petrol. Compared to other solutions, it is the most practical way to directly improve the environment. However, some people argue that this way is not optimal to reduce the spending of fuel.

On the other hand, it is necessary that the government should come up with stricter laws about the fuel of transportation. In particular, they need to promulgate more administrative laws for the polluted fuel which eliminate numerous CO2 or harmful substances for the environment. In some developed countries such as Europe, they forbid transportations that negatively affects the ecosystem , especially trucks. In addition, the government should cooperate with the media to organize more campaigns to advance the awareness of citizens. Currently, they are exploring a number of new fuels that would instead be detrimental fuel for vehicles and it is more environmentally friendly.

In conclusion, the growth of the price of fuel for cars or other vehicles has some limitations. Thus, there must be a more acceptable solution to improve the environment.","**Task Achievement:**

"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Many individuals believe that businesses have social responsibilities, alongside earning money. However, I partly agree with this statement. 

  Some people think that companies should only concentrate on making money rather than their social responsibilities for two main factors. Firstly, if a factory considers the social effects of their products excessively, they will suffer from the hard-tight rules and standards, which prevent the business from progressing. In other words, these corporations will be asked to be more cautious and not to take risks in order to gain more money. For example, if companies that work on AI were worried about people's personal security too much, they would not make such progress that they have made by now, as they have access to every detail of a person's life. Secondly, caring about the social impacts of a business sometimes affects the income of a factory as well. After producing a product, it can bring about some side effects for consumers, and if the producer is responsible for paying compensation, their income will become lower, because they have to cover the damages made to the consumers. 

  On the other hand, businesses should be socially responsible for two major reasons. These traders are doing business in a country, and they are more powerful than ordinary people, due to the fact that they have more money. Thus, they must be responsible to the public. It is a global rule that those who earn more money in a business must take responsibility as well. Moreover, in some cases, safety is more important than making progress. To exemplify, biotechnological goods are really dangerous and should be used and produced in a safe manner. These products can easily create health issues like those related to one's digestion. As a result, their producers have to take care of this situation. 

  In conclusion, even though companies are trading and making money by that, they should also consider social responsibilities for numerous reasons.","### Task Achievement:

"As well as making money , businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Businesses have sets of principles. Earning profits has the same importance as social responsibilities for businesses. I largely agree with this point and I will outline my reasons in this essay.

There are other factors which accompany the purpose of making money that promotes companies in long term.Social responsibilities have played a crucial role to hold businesses in their paths.To name an exquisite example , there were companies which produced plastics. Although they reached the niche of becoming prosperous , it was only for a short time Because as people figured out the disadvantage of plastics that harms the environment due to incapability to recycle , most people refused to buy them and those businesses have become faded in long term.

In most developed countries , government determine obligation for businesses in terms of social responsibility such as environmental responsibility by establishing taxes and allocating budget for campaigns to observe the function of businesses. Hence , companies should respect and follow the rules to stay in the market.

"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is true that businesses need to make a profit in order to not declare bankruptcy. Some people have opinions about whether businesses should have public responsibilities. From my perspective, I totally agree with the statement.

To begin with, it seems logical that businesses must make a profit in order to cover their overhead cost. Without profiting from their business, companies might not be able to cover their running costs, such as employees’ salaries, facilities, and payments for the building. As a result, companies might declare bankruptcy, and end up closing down their businesses. Another argument is that without making profits, businesses might not be able to fulfil their social responsibilities. This is because when businesses can not cover their running cost or fulfil customers’ demands, any social concerns might be neglected. In other words, less attention might be paid to public concern, simply because this is not businesses’ main purpose. This means if a business is not in good financial health, it might not be able to fulfil public concerns. 

On the other hand, businesses should also fulfil their public responsibilities, instead of focusing on the sole purpose of maximising their profits. Firstly, one social concern that is associated with managers and businesses is to treat their employees well. Treating employees right might provide them with the comfortability needed to improve their work efficiency, boosting the country’s economy. Lastly, I believe that companies should stop abusing accounting loopholes to minimise their taxes. Paying taxes is an essential part of businesses’ social responsibility.

"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. 
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The role of companies is to produce all the goods we need to satisfy the request of society. However, many people support the idea that they have also social commitments.

In this essay, I will agree with the afore-mentioned statement which every company is also responsible for their employees and the environmental problem.

Firstly, commercial activities should give the right weight to human resources. In order to work and sell goods or services, companies foremost need people who are relevant to the role that they have in the process. On the other hand, employees need more than the salary at the end of the month, it is essential to value their work through rights and respect. 

It is vitally important that people could work in a safe place where their well-being is guaranteed, For example, for fabric employees, is extremely significant that the companies provide to everyone the tools to work in a safe way, such as glove’s pair, adapt shoes, and a helmet.

Furthermore, businesses have also an environmental engagement. Due to the increment of the purchases, the consumption of resources is rose.  

In the consumer era, it became drastic the respect for the planet. In the current situation, companies have the responsibility to adopt measurements to decrease consumer levels.

Solutions, such as solar panel use or preferring renewable resources enterprises could do a difference, and that could be the first approach to the problem.

"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Although earning money is one of the most important factors when people conduct business, those who run companies should take social responsibility. In my opinion, while generating profit is the top priority for each company, I agree that firms should have the responsibility to society.

There are many reasons why firms should allocate resources to help the community. Firstly, this may help companies promote their public image and increase their sales figures. For example, big corporations such as Vinamilk and FPT should have philanthropic activities such as providing scholarships and giving charitable donations to help those who are less fortunate. Secondly, production processes may lead to serious environmental degradation such as pollution and global warming stemming from factory emissions and the irresponsible disposal of chemical waste. Thus, firms should spend their income installing waste treatment systems and solving these environmental issues along with the governments.

However, The efforts of businesses to earn their profits may bring some tangible benefits to society. The first reason is that they have the opportunity to expand their businesses thanks to their income. So, this creates new job opportunities for workers and reduces crime in many countries. Another reason is that the more money companies earn, the more taxes they pay to the government. As a result, authorities can have more revenue to spend in key fields such as education, health care, and transportation. So, this contributes to improving the quality of life of local communities.

In conclusion, although I recognize that increasing profits is the fundamental principle of business, I would argue that all companies should be responsible for society.","**Task Achievement:**

"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","IIt is argued by many people that companies have necessary communal duties in addition to making a profit, while others claims that making profit  is the fundamental aspect for them so they can  focus only their gains.

To begin with, companies budget is restricted so they cannot allocate funds to social investments. To demonstrate, many firms prefer to invest their limited funds to infrastructures for their companies such as new production systems, education for their workers. In 2012,  I worked in a company and this firm has a chance to construct a fitness centre for workers, these place probable increased labor’s  motivations, while firm owner preferred to buy a new machine for production.  Without doubt, this company  was eager to  allacote funds for public awareness due to this machine was capable for gain more income than personal’s motivation.
In addition, many companies are prone to social developments. To illustrates, if citizens adjusted better life conditions, they would want to new social opportunities. Without doubt, no firm does not jeopardize their system. According to Hans Brigel, a history professor at Cambridge University, Ottoman Empire’s economy system was collapsed due to globalization. As can be predicted, many labour heard new gadgets, high-quality fabric, especially coffee. Price of the coffee was excess to an Ottoman worker’s monthly salary so citizens wanted an improvement at their income. This improvements affected the budget of the government. Finally, Ottoman’s treasure went to the debt due to personal’s wages.
Finally, some business is eager to allocate a budget for the public duty due to their marketing strategy. To demonstrate, these companies gain customers with their social investments. Kellogs, one of the biggest cereal producers in the world, they invest %20 of their income to UNICEF and Red Cross so they  gained customer’s sympathies. As stated by an observation company that they observed 100.000 people who ate one cup of Kellogs cornflakes in their breakfast. Surprisingly, %70 of them preferred to Kellogs due to their social supports.
In conclusion,  social awareness is not compulsory for firms, because paying their labour’s wage and making profits are  their crucial duties so they cannot jeopardize their budget for the communities benefits.","**Task Achievement: 4**

"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In this modern era , everyone needs money for the their survival and plays an indispensable role . After making money , organization have some social duty . I personally believe that a business should pay attention towards social responsibility.

To begin with , enterprises have many responsibility regarding society and they need to fulfil it because a business operates in a society. Besides this ,  a business  gets resources from society , thus it's duty of a organization to pay back to society.  For instance , if a enterprise gets its raw material 
from community than a company will provide good quality product in return. Secondly, if a business perform it's duty very well then it will somehow benefits the entire community as well as enterprise, because it will increase the sale , additionally reputation of company will become good.

On the other hand , sometime social responsibility  creates loss for a company as  when they organise a  free health check up or give charity etc because all this money is withdrawn from company's profit . However , company by doing it's social responsibility generates employment , so whenever a new enterprise  starts it give job to numerous people.

"Nations should spend more money on skills and vocational training for practical work, rather than on university education.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Many today feel that countries should prioritise vocational training over higher education due to changes in the labour market. In my opinion, though there are strong economic reasons to support this idea, university education holds greater value.

Those in favour of more practical skills training point out the financial benefits. Most university graduates are burdened with student debt and face uncertain job prospects. In contrast, training schools are cheap, fast, and ease students into steady employment immediately. The jobs they train for are also most likely recession-proof and durable, including positions as cooks, hotel managers, and skilled technicians. Someone who is firmly established in such a job in their early 20s does not have to deal with the pressure associated with university life and its incumbent debts. Instead, they can begin to set aside money for a house or start a family.

Nonetheless, lacking a university degree limit one's options. The jobs available will pay well initially and be secure, but offer narrow scope for advancement and virtually no opportunity to switch the career paths. An individual with a university degree, on the other hand, might begin from a lower position, but has a higher ceiling on future earnings. It is also possible for them to explore a variety of fields. Most good jobs require at least a bachelor’s degree even for simple internship vacancies. Lacking such a degree, means restricting oneself to manual labour or service industry jobs. The actual learning that takes place at university, particularly for those with multi skills majors or studying at liberal art schools, also encourages students to consider a wide range of possible career options.

In conclusion, increasing funding for vocational training is an attractive yet short sighted approach that curbs possibilities. Governments ought to continue to support higher education even in dark economic times in order to reap future rewards.","## Task Achievement:
