However, some people think that interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ and there are better methods. To what extent to you agree or disagree?","To agree or disagree with the statement that interviews are the basic filteration criteria is an important issue. Putting the discussion in a wider context, interviews has always been debatable. Even though some people think that there are better methods for employing a resource rather than interviews , I wholeheartedly believe that interview is a good method for recruiting candidates. First I will discuss some arguments supporting my ideas about this statement, after which some aspects against that will be presented.<NL><NL> On the one hand, many people agree with this statement for many noteworthy reasons. The most remarkable is that the recruiters can get an idea about the personalitty and skills of the potential employees .For instance,when the person is asked about any topic and he answers it in a concise and crisp manner,then the recruiter gets to know he is suitable for the job. Another key reason is that if a candidate is asked about case studies then the recruiters can judge the personality traits of that employee and also the ability to think outside the box.<NL><NL>On the other hand, other people disagree with this statement for many reasons. They believe that other modes of recruiting like written tests and group discussions will help understand the mindset in a better manner.Written tests help in evaluating the technical or theoretical knowlege of a person.<NL><NL>Group discussions help in getting a grasp of the conversational skills that he/she possesses.For example,in sales and marketing jobs conversational skills play a major role.  <NL><NL> All in all, when all the specific reasons and relevant examples are considered and evaluated,  I strongly  agree with the idea supporting this statement because its benefits outweigh its drawbacks.",6.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.937955,0,hf
518383096320352768,The increase in the production of consumer consumption goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this and what can be done to solve this problem?,"It is true that the rise in consumer production has detrimental impacts on the natural environment. This essay will discuss the causes behind the environmental damage and propose potential solutions to mitigate these consequences.<NL><NL>There are two primary reasons why the increase in consumer goods manufacturing poses a threat to the natural environment. Firstly, the extraction of natural resources leads to devastating ecosystem disruption. Consumer goods production heavily relies on the extraction of minerals, fossil fuels, and timber, resulting in habitat destruction, deforestation, and the depletion of non-renewable resources. For example, the widespread demand for electronic devices has led to increased mining activities, contributing to ecological disruption and soil erosion. Additionally, the logging industry for furniture production has resulted in intensive deforestation, causing a loss of biodiversity. Secondly, the energy-intensive manufacturing processes and transportation used for goods delivery account for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, pushing the Earth towards a climate crisis.<NL><NL>To tackle these consequences, several measures can be implemented. The first solution is to encourage companies to adopt sustainable sourcing practices to ensure responsible extraction of resources and minimize habitat destruction. For instance, enterprises can prioritize the use of recycled materials and promote sustainable forestry practices, such as tree replanting initiatives. Furthermore, investing in research and development of alternative materials with lower environmental impacts, such as biodegradable plastics, and renewable energy technologies can help reduce the reliance on scarce resources. The second solution involves governments offering incentives, such as providing tax deductions and implementing regulations, to encourage industries to transition to renewable energy sources, improve energy efficiency in manufacturing processes, and adopt greener approaches.<NL><NL>In conclusion, various measures can be taken to address the environmental issues caused by the growth of consumer goods manufacturing. To achieve better results in environmental protection in the future, companies need to be fully aware of the negative impacts and adopt appropriate sustainable practices, with oversight and support from governments. By implementing these measures, we can work towards a more sustainable future and mitigate the detrimental effects of consumer production on the natural environment.",8.0,2024-11-25 18:05:38.937989,0,hf
922538481792244210,The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"It is widely argued that the growth of the number of factories producing customer products has a negative impact on various aspects of the natural habitat. The essay attempts to shed light on the driving factors behind this negative view before outlining several viable solutions that should be adopted to tackle the mentioned problem. <NL><NL>There are two primary reasons why some individuals often consider the production of consumer goods as a cause of many serious issues in the natural habitat. One reason is, it often starts from the origin of products that serve people's daily needs. We can name a lot of goods such as food, drinks, pencils, paper, clothes, or electronics. They are mass-produced to meet human needs, so large firms are needed to resolve this problem. Of course, it is quite difficult to build large-scale factories in the city, on the contrary, they are built in the countryside, leading to many consequences for the surrounding areas. A large number of trees were cut down to give way to new factories, reducing the area of forest cover significantly. In addition, their waste that is not properly treated will harm the soil and water habitat, affecting aquatic or underground ecosystems. Another reason is that some customer merchandise is produced with natural ingredients. For instance, paper is made of wood, and dishes are made of sand. The ensure them to mass production leads to the over-exploitation of these resources, leading to the risk of imbalance in the natural ecosystem.<NL><NL>To combat this worrying concern, the following feasible steps should be taken. First and foremost, the unquestionable impacts of production companies on the surrounding areas should be promoted widely through official media. As a result, local residents could be able to be aware of the economic benefits that also affect the environment which manufacturing firms play in their lives, thereby making them change their oppositional or acceptable attitudes towards these companies. Furthermore, governing bodies should enforce strict regulations on these commodities manufacturing industries. For example, they could impose heavy fines on those littering or polluting the local environment to these manufacturing firms, which could protect the local environment from being contaminated by the irresponsible behaviour of these enterprises.<NL><NL>In conclusion, there are some underlying motives behind this negative perception towards the industry of consumer products, and it is crucial that the aforementioned measures be implemented to change this oppositional perspective.",8.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.938008,0,hf

What can be done to solve this problem?,"The production of new items and objects have been a well discussed topic recently in our society. Many people explain that the growth of world economy has brought harmful effect in the atmosphere. Nonetheless, others argue that it is necessary the creation of new goods as well as services. In this essay, I am going to analize the issue of new things, and at the end, I will give possible solutions of these problems.<NL><NL>On one hand, undoubtedly, it is a reality that new goods have helped to increase the air pollution. For example: In the last years, the population has been increasing dramatically. Therefore, we need more products in order to conservate the life quality. As result, we demand more services and items such as clothes, cars, and food thus we produce more pollution along with garbage. Under these circumstances our environment was damaged for the increase of new products.

What can be done to solve this problem?,"In recent years, an increase in the manufacture of consumer goods has been seen. While this is connected to population growth, it has resulted in an increase in a detrimental effect to the environment. In this essay I will look at 2 possible causes for this as well as suggest some solutions. <NL><NL>Due to the extreme high volumes of manufacturers in order to meet the increasing demand of products, there has been an increase in factory produced CO2 gases. This is because the manufacturing processes have not become more efficient as quantities have risen. In China for example, many new factories have sprung up over the last few decades resulting in huge quantities of pollution being fed into the air. If factories were to spend funding on researching more efficient manufacturing processes, the amount of polluted air would be decreased. Manufacturers in their numbers, should concentrate on reducing CO2 production. <NL><NL>With the increase of factory workers, there has been a matching increase in the transportation of these workers to the facilities. In addition to this, there is an obvious rise in the transportation of products, all of which has resulted in higher Carbon gas emissions form vehicles involved in the process. The number of busses and trucks carrying labourers to and products from the factories in China have added to the already polluted atmosphere in the country. Improved and more efficient vehicles using no fossil fuels, such as in electric vehicles, or less fuel will improve this situation. Transportation accounts for a large percentage of the worlds total carbon gas production.<NL><NL>While it is understandable that we need more manufacturing facilities for the ever-increasing world population, we need factories who take environmental issues seriously. Factory management need to ask themselves the question, ""are we doing enough to minimize our carbon footprint?",4.0,2024-11-25 18:05:38.938036,0,hf
670046961255398892,The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"The natural environment is harmed as a result of increased consumer goods manufacturing. The main reason for this is that the products which involve chemical materials are harmful to the environment and a viable solution is to make strict laws to protect the environment. <NL><NL>First of all, one of the first problems of that the number of people consuming increases year after year, and some of them consume more than they need. In the other words, when people consume more products, they become product more goods. In addition, all manufacturers want to meet the demands of their consumers. As more goods are produced, toxic wastes are released from factories into nature. For example, more single-use products are introduced, most of which are non-biodegradable.  These products can remain as waste for thousands of years,  turning our planet into a huge landfill.<NL><NL>A solution that is some measures should be taken by the government. Manufacturers also  should be encouraged to use eco-friendlier materials. For example, the WWF which is a famous brand in Turkey has recently replaced nylon and polyester clothes with reusable alternatives made of materials like cotton or wool. Thus, the clothes which are produced by WWF can be recycled.  <NL><NL>To conclude, the major problem of damage to the natural environment caused by the excessive consumption of products can be partly alleviated by making laws. Furthermore, it is predictable that the number of factories which use eco-friendly materials will increase over time. . . .  . . .  . . .  .",8.0,2024-11-25 18:05:38.938049,0,hf
946952306506398612,The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the cause of this ? what can be done to solve this problem.,"t is maintained by some that students execute better when in a single-gender school, compared to a co-educational environment. However, in my opinion enrolling children in a mixed school is of utmost importance as it prepares them for the real world.<NL><NL>To begin with, co-educational institutes allow pupils to develop their team working and interpersonal skills. Teamwork provides ample opportunities for the students to interact and work together, which is completely lacking in single-sex schools. This can have a positive impact as at the present competitive market, employers are keener to hire individuals who can incorporate team spirit and social skills. In other words, when both the genders are able to communicate effectively and comfortably to achieve a task together, they have better career prospects in the future.<NL><NL>Another point to consider is that children are able to acquire a deeper understanding of the opposite gender and their views. As boys and girls have a different outlook on life, they can learn and benefit from each other in a coeducational setting. For instance, students assigned to work on a group project, can see aspects from a different angle and perspective, which results in a more positive outcome.<NL><NL>Finally, being taught together encourages competition between genders, which can often give rise to better results. In a competitive learning environment, students are more driven to succeed and surpass one another to achieve the desires outcomes. The majority of boys in co-educational schools perform better academically compared to the ones in same-sex schools, due to the fear of bad grades and feeling inferior in front of their female counterparts.<NL><NL>In conclusion, I believe mixed schools are better for the youngsters in the long run, particularly career-wise as it mirrors the real world much more closely than single gender schools.",6.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.938066,0,hf
536384985123080059,The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"There has been a rise in producing consumer products, which leads to harmful impacts on the natural environment. While there are some reasons why this trend happens, several solutions can be taken to solve this problem.<NL><NL>To begin with, this tendency happens due to a number of reasons. The first one is that the more products people manufacture, the more trash such as defective items people throw at the nature, especially the aquatic habitat. This would result in water or air pollution. Additionally, in order to get necessary materials such as wood for the manufacturing process, businesses’ owners normally have to gain them by exploiting from the environment, which could lead to deforestation or soil erosion. For example, the Son Tung logging company used to cut trees a lot, which led to the biggest flood ever recorded in the history of Vietnam.<NL><NL>Fortunately, several measures can be done to deal with this issue. Firstly, entrepreneurs can apply technological developments to recycle trash, so that, these trash can be used again and again. By following this idea, enterprises can reduce the regularity of leaving trash in the nature. Secondly, the government should apply some laws against exploiting natural resources. For example, if I keep illegally deforesting the Amazon rainforest despite not being allowed to do it, I might result in  permanently being in jail as a punishment or even being put to death penalty.<NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, when manufacturing consumer goods, people exploit resources from and throw trash at the environment, which would lead to negative impacts on nature. Applying the newest technologies and some strict laws can help to solve this serious issue.",5.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.938084,0,hf
536626551771802283,The increase in the production of consumer goods results in damage to the natural environment. What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?,"In the last few decades, our society has witnessed the rise of the industrial revolution around the world, which in turn leads to the excessive mass production of goods growing beyond consumer demand. As a social and economic phenomena, it has had several impacts on the natural world and the living conditions of humankind. In this essay, I will discuss the main causes that give rise to the overproduction of goods and offer some measures to tackle this problem.<NL>The root of an excessive supply of products lies within the evolution of human society itself. Among many possible reasons that cause the glut of goods, consumerism is considered to be the main culprit. Because of the belief that certain merchandise do not hold the same value anymore when it is out of style, in tandem with the ever-increasing appearance of advertisement in every household, modern citizens are convinced to believe that they must stay up to date with the ongoing trends by purchasing new products even though their old ones still function well. Recent researches have shown that today’s people have the tendency to buy the newest and the most fashionable smartphone models in the marketplace, despise the fact that their current mobile phone is not out of date yet. Another trend of human society that has helped create the excess of supply is the planned obsolescence. Modern companies intentionally design their products to be out of use after a short span of time such as clothes, shoes or smartphone batteries and thus force the costumers to come back to buy new ones. As a result, the two above reasons encourage people to keep buying unnecessarily new merchandise and therefore start the chain of overproduction. In the end, for the industrial production requires different resources which come from the natural world, the oversupply will eventually lead to environmental degradation, for example the unrestrained development of pulp and paper industry will lead to deforestation or the overfishing of seafood industry will result in the loss of marine life.<NL>In response to solve this increasing adverse effect, some viable solutions must put forward. Firstly, the government should implement a law to ban manufacturers to plan the failure of their goods and encourage them to produce more durable products, so consumers do not have to replace their bought products too frequently. Secondly, the media should promote environmental programs that raise awareness of overconsumption and overproduction. For example, a tv program that shows the harmful effects of excessive unsustainable production on ecosystem health will inspire people to buy less and not contribute to the oversupply of goods. Once the buyers are aware of how their shopping habit can have serious impacts on the environment and decide to end this toxic practice, the excess of supply will not be a problem anymore.<NL>In conclusion, it must be said that the overabundance of products is a contentious topic with no easy answers. However, in my mind, the most effective solutions would be to encourage the consumers to do shopping responsibly by not buying goods for unnecessary trends. It is not unrealistic to expect that raising consumers’ awareness will help reduce the increase of producing goods in the impending future.",7.0,2024-11-25 18:05:38.938109,0,hf

How can we solve this problem?,"Education is the key to becoming successful in life, however, most of the students find it difficult to concentrate on studying at school. Although they feel distracted, there are a lot of courses that students need to cover, and I will discuss possible solutions for improving their concentration in the upcoming paragraphs. <NL><NL>Firstly, the main reason that the students are unable to attention to study is that they feel fear because of the extra syllabus as they feel they are unable to finish on time. For instance, most learners prefer to complete topics which are easy as otherwise they feel a stress on mind to finish it. Secondly, children love to spend time on the internet where they play video games up to late at night which is the main distraction as they are unable to get proper sleep due to which they have lack of energy to focus on their studies. <NL><NL>The prominent solution for improving the curiosity of students towards their studies is that they make proper time for sleep which helps for the proper functioning of the brain. Elders have to make strict rules regarding the playing time of the kids so they get enough time to complete the homework as well as get time to revise class work.  <NL><NL>To conclude, children want to play video games most of the time which is the main cause that they do not like studying, whereas, their parents should make strict rules to limit their play time so they can focus better on education.",6.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.938124,0,hf

How can we solve this problem?,"It is true that many children find it difficult to focus on the course at school. There are many reasons behind this phenomenon, so we need to take a comprehensive approach to mitigate it.<NL><NL>On the one hand, several factors contribute to this aissue. One of the reasons is the development of technology such as the applications of smartphones. With smartphones, many students are addicted to the virtual world brought about by mobile games and gain a sense of achievement<NL><NL>, which cannot be found in schools. The influence of the environment is another main reason. For example, if the juveniles around them behave badly in schools like talking to others or sleeping in classes without being punished by teachers, which may have a bad impact on them and they may imitate this behaviour, leading to their lack of focus on their school work.<NL><NL>However, many measures can be taken to solve this problem. To begin with, parents can take children to do some outdoor activities such as kite flying and hiking. They are good ways for juveniles to get close to nature and be away from the virtual world. Then the children may understand the beauty of the real world. Furthermore, improving teaching quality is also important, which means teachers can make their teaching content more abundant to increase the opportunity for interaction with students. For instance, teachers should introduce more entertaining activities in classes such as brainstorming and group discussions. By doing so, the minors can focus more on the course at schools.<NL><NL>In conclusion, the development of technology and the influence of the environment are the main reasons why it is difficult for students to catch the course at school, but actions should be taken along several aspects through doing outdoor activities and heightening teaching quality.",6.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.938141,0,hf

911972370296336651,Children find it difficult to concentrate on or pay attention to school. <NL>What are the reasons? How can we solve this problem?,"Education plays a pivotal role in children’s developmental years, and the quality of which requires the dedication of both students and teachers. Unfortunately, it is found that children in schools are not engrossed in study. Does this mean that teachers are unqualified or are students themselves to blame? What are the remedies to overcome this problem?<NL>Adolescents’ innate characteristics should be brought into close scrutiny. Children, as non-grownups, are generally less self-disciplined. This means that they are ofttimes unable to control their concentration, easily affected by distractions such as a sudden sound or an idea that pops up and is unrelated with the class.  Each time students get sidetracked, they would miss the important points that teachers are elaborating. To combat this productivity-damaging weakness, there should be more research on strengthening children’s concentration. The ability to focus on important tasks for a longer duration of time could keep students from absent-mindedness and boost learning efficiency.<NL>Another cause of this problem is attributed to ineffective teaching. These days, many teachers are not doing a good job. They constantly adopt teacher-centred methods in class, without taking into account students’ preferences.  This inappropriate method could demotivate students, making them lose interest in study. The solution would be to opt for a student-centred attitude. Teachers could integrate into their class livelier and more inspiring elements, so that the classes they teach would be more in line with young people’s taste.  With an intense interest in what the teachers are saying, the students would voluntarily engross themselves in these absorbing topics.<NL>In summary, adolescents’ shortcoming in self-discipline and the mechanical teaching strategy chosen by teachers are held accountable for pupils’ inability to focus on study.

Accordingly, there are many approaches in order to solve this major problem. While there are some people who consider climate change as something that can be lived with, others give it extreme importance and look for powerful solutions for its prevention. I strongly believe that this severe issue is something to be dealt with. For that reason, we must take individual actions and force governments to act in accordance with necessary precautions.<NL><NL>First and foremost, I must state that raising awareness and commencing individual action constitutes the most effective part considering the prevention of the alterations in the climate. Specifically, individual action forms a cumulative organization due to its nature. To illustrate, decreasing the frequency of using automobiles and aircraft makes a considerable difference in terms of the continuing process of climate change. Clearly, it provides low waste of gas which spreads to the air. <NL><NL>Second, after taking individual action, people must cajole governments into taking relevant measures for the elimination of possible outcomes of this matter. Furthermore, all around the world, governments are initiating and managing investments with a plethora of other governments or private companies in order to maintain economic development. However, the irresponsible behaviour of politicians in monetary terms harms the future of young generations. Therefore, to exemplify, people must force governments not to make investments in fossil fuel and sectors that cause high carbon emissions.<NL><NL>In conclusion, the tendency of living with climate change and not trying to stop its negative effects in the environment should never be the policy of any country. We absolutely cannot just live with it.

In my opinion, I completely disagree with this opinion.<NL><NL>Firstly, we should create awareness among the people to grow more and more trees. Consequently, this lush green beauty helps in controlling the increasing temperature on the earth. As trees are considered to be the best absorbent of hazardous carbon dioxide gas.

As this pollution is depleting our ozone layer which directly impacts the climate. Furthermore, this layer is responsible for saving our planet from the heat of the sun. Thus, use of electric vehicles and alternative fuels should be encouraged to deal with climate change.

Governments could introduce laws to limit the carbon dioxide emissions that lead to global warming. They could impose “green taxes” on drivers, airline companies and other polluters, and they could invest in renewable energy production from solar, wind or water power.

It is concerned whether it is an obligation of the government to alleviate this issue or whether the nation is responsible for the lack of accommodation. I firmly believe that both parties should integrate and contribute to the solutions. <NL><NL>To begin with, there is ample evidence that sustainable housing is strongly due to government regulations. That is to say, political houses should establish certain restrictions on the numbers of people and land that is distributed to each citizen. For instance, a recent survey has revealed that 25 countries had a scarcity of land to construct new houses because of the fact that government didn't allocate the land properly and residents were prone to build large houses in order to outperform one another, which later caused housing shortages in multifold metropolitan cities. <NL><NL>Secondly, it is explicit that because of the nation's unprofitable purchase of lands and housing facilities, it has become prevalent to some citizens to inevitably live in flats and accommodations. It can be solved by public organisations that can share and divide some houses, which indicates that the government is not fully liable for such an issue. For example, several cities concluded that this problem is partly due to people's actions, 45 per cent of which could solve this problem by uniting both the government and the nation. <NL><NL>To conclude, it can be clearly seen that I strongly advocate that it is not only feasible for the government to come up with a solution, but also citizens of the city are able to resolve the scarcity of housing.",5.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.938803,0,hf

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In recent years, the increasing population has caused trouble in purchasing lands. On the one hand,  the society argues the fact that authorities should make remedy actions to fix an issue of inadequate  residences. However, on other hand, people themselves should solve this issue. I partially agree  with the given statement, and I will provide the substantiate argument in upcoming  paragraphs.  To commence, the government should restrict the allocation of land. To put it another way, government should apply more taxes to real estate so that they limit the making of houses.  Moreover, a focus on vertical housing would help to resolve the issue of even distribution of  homes. As an illustration, the apartments, and townhouses in developed cities like Singapore,  are made in a vertical manner in limited areas. Furthermore, authorities should apply more taxes  to bungalows and large houses. Therefore, people would purchase less of them. As an example,  the Canadian government restrict the purchase of houses for two years to resolve the issue of housing shortage.  On a contrary, people could also solve this issue by themselves. To simplify, they should prefer  living in villages and outskirts of towns instead of living in bigger cities. People can find more job  opportunities like farming in villages to earn a livelihood. This would help in bringing more  employment in the country and in this manner, society could also develop the villages. The fresh air  of villages would also make people more healthy and less stressed. Therefore, it would reduce  crimes in society.

To exemplify it one of my friends was doing a job right after finishing  school, he was doing a job in the automobile industry and was earning a good amount of money apart from that he also paid his complete education fee on his own he didn’t take a single penny from his parents, his father always say that I am proud of my son that how responsible he was during his early age of life, secondly he got  admission in the engineering university and was doing automobile engineering and he always scored good marks in every subject not only that he also got the job right after completing his degree because he already had a decent amount of experience in this industry he did not found the job, job found him, hence it is also suggested that students should start the job after completing his or her school <NL><NL>As we have seen that there are no easy answers to these questions.

Discuss both views.","Whether a university’s role should be to prepare graduates for specific jobs or simply to educate without a particular vocation in mind is a debatable issue. This essay believes that universities fulfil both purposes. The essay will first discuss the function of vocational courses, followed by a discussion of more traditional tertiary education.<NL><NL>Some students have a very specific job in mind when they enrol at university. Medicine, dentistry and accountancy have clear career paths and they allow people to focus on and then undertake a certain profession upon graduation. This suits those who have decided on a career and it avoids them wasting time studying a more general subject like English. For instance, in the United States, you must complete four years of higher education before you can study law and many feel that these four years are a waste of time, that would have been better used focusing on their chosen discipline.<NL><NL>However, this is not suitable for everyone and many people have no idea what job they would like to do when they are 18. For these young people, it is better to do a non-vocational course, such as philosophy and simply add to their intellect without a career goal in mind. If they were forced to study a more practical subject, they are more likely to quit or become disillusioned because they don’t see the point of their chosen subject. For example, The Times recently reported that only 50% of law graduates actually want to become lawyers at the end of their studies.<NL><NL>In conclusion, the function of the college is to both prepare students for the workforce and provide knowledge and which one a person chooses should depend on their preference at the time.",8.0,2024-11-25 18:05:38.939071,0,hf

And that is the reason why I strongly believe that governments should spend more money on this, for instance nowadays unfortunately there are many people who can not afford to go to school and be educated due the the lack of money but if governments give those residents money to attend to school and learn how to write or read that problem will be solved in no time.<NL><NL>Secondly, if people do not know how to write or read they will never be able to find a job and needless to say that without working they can not survive and it can lead them to commit crimes to live.

Therefore, public authorities should regulate the consumption of eatables thinking some folks while other opposes that humans should not be limited for the same. Analysing that I opine, the ministry needs to make laws in order to create a barrier for obesity and health problems that are being faced by humans globally.<NL><NL>On the one hand, more and more population is becoming obese as junk food is the major meal of the day. In America, almost 60 per cent of the citizens rely upon burgers and pizzas for their daily consumption as it is readily available and tasty in comparison to other eatables. Clearly, such sort of health concerns is alarming to the law because citizens are being careless by choosing unhealthy preferences. Thus, it needs to regulate strict laws like banning fast-food chains in order to create awareness among residents.<NL><NL>On the other hand, it is a basic right of the public to consume as per their taste buds. Consequently, government has no role to play in this case yet society should be clearly responsible for the products they eat. From some stats, it led to a big fight when some people protested to close the pizza stores all over the country. Furthermore, every individual has the freedom to consume as per their desire even if it is harmful to them, they are only responsible for it. If it is not harming others then why would authorities need to make any laws since the population is only to be blamed for the damage they are causing to themselves?<NL><NL>In conclusion, in my opinion, the health issues arising around the Earth mainly contributing to humans not eating healthy food should be considered by the government as it is causing damage to the mass now.

In my opinion, the advantages of this phenomenon overshadow the disadntages.<NL><NL><NL><NL>There are a number of reasons why some people believed that  developing business and cultural cooperation has an adverse impact on their national identities. First, the globalisation poses a serious threat to traditional and culture value of a nation. This can be explained by the fact that multinational corporations often use their national image and culture to advertise their items, which trigger curiously potential customers that come from overseas.

Second, International commerce and cultural exchange are considered as a golden chance for local companies to flourish in the global market. This means that, In order to compete with international companies, local companies have to be more creative and innovative, they also have much more opportunities to approach new technology and modern machines from other countries.

By doing so, they will not become too dependent on it and free their minds. Another possible way is returning to low-tech devices. To be specific, studies have shown that people may be happier and more satisfied if they are given fewer options in life. Hence, by using devices with few quirks and features, it is likely that they may experience a more fulfilling life, as well as appreciate what they have.

This is because there were a lot of prejudices about the female part of  society and their duties to the world. Therefore, young girls used to think about pregnancy at the age of 18 since they were told that after this age it would be difficult to get a good family.

Several reasons are responsible for this, and I believe that it has more consequences. <NL><NL><NL><NL>Firstly, couples want to spend quality time together before having their first child. This is because they can enjoy their life with each other, and be able to know one another. In this way, mutual understanding becomes stronger, and enjoy the time they spend with their young ones. For example, research studies have shown that couples who spend more time together understanding each other can later take good care of their babies and there is also less chance of divorce rate after having children birth.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Secondly, people choose to concentrate on their careers first and then have babies it is because they can take better care of their juveniles. Additionally, they think having children can escalate the expenditures and financial responsibilities of parents. Therefore, they achieve a stable financial position before starting the family as a result this can enable parents to give better education and lifestyle to their children. For instance, parents would be capable of enrolling their juveniles in schools where they get quality education and learn co-circular activities, which are not available in all schools.<NL><NL><NL><NL>However, the drawbacks can not be underestimated. The main problem caused by giving birth later is related to the fertility of both genders. After a certain age, sometimes their fertility rate starts decreasing, due to which they face difficulties in conceiving babies, and pregnant women require special care. To exemplify, studies show that children who are born in later years are often born with some abnormalities, either in terms of physical or mental. Thus, they face problems to survive in this world.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, although there are various merits of giving birth to a baby, a single disadvantage is more dangerous for both mother and child as they are sometimes prone to death.",6.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.939611,0,hf

In this essay the factors will be discussed followed with my opinion on this.<NL><NL><NL><NL>As the world develops, living standards have become higher. Consequently, this increases living expense. In order to make sure children gets a decent tertiary education many parents start saving for their children education fund early. This, is only a tip of the ice berg as children will incur other expense such as food, medical, clothes, etc. Adding up all these, many modern young couples have family planning and priorities on reaching stable financial situation before having children. This is an inevitable impact as the economy grows and people try to make more money for a comfortable life.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Secondly, as society becomes more educated, both men and women spend longer time in formal education. By the time university students graduate, they are on average 25 years old. Some of the more ambitious ones will choose to focus on their personal goal or career accomplishment before settling down on forming a family. One thing leads to another, couples choose to get married late will eventually starting the parenthood journey late. <NL><NL><NL><NL>Another key factor on why people choose to have children late is they prefer to be more matured, emotionally and mentally before their children come along. This is because many view having children as a enormous task in life, it involves a lot of coaching to the young ones and setting their future path correctly. Hence, they prefer to take longer time for preparation.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In summary, there are benefits as well as downsides of having children late.

In the following paragraphs, I will discuss  the possible reasons for this thinking and further, I will give valid points as to why having children later in life could possibly lead to disadvantages.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To begin with, the root cause for this mindset is that nowadays, society has money minds and they want to earn a handsome amount of money in the initial stage of their career. For the purpose of earning money, young couples avoid conceiving, because they think that with kids, they will not be able to target  their careers. Furthermore, the young generation like to do social interactive activities by having parties  and going on vacation with friends and they like to enjoy their life like a free bird. But, our generation believes that after having a child, life will not be the same. So, that's why couples avoid having kids at the early stage of marriage. For instance, after a child, you cannot go to late-night parties and you cannot leave him alone at home. So, after having offspring, your whole day revolves around them and you cannot spare time for yourself and it is a valid reason by people do not want to conceive early.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Though  people want to have kids later, there are certain drawbacks to choosing this path. Firstly, after a certain age, the count of sperm decreases and similarly females also start facing hormonal issues due to which sometimes it becomes impossible to give birth to a baby naturally. The second drawback is that when  individual plans to have offspring at a later stage, in this case, the age gap between parents and children increases. Due to this, there is a generation gap among both  generations which leads to clashes between children and parents. <NL><NL><NL><NL>So, in the end, I would like to conclude that though a career also matters in the individual's life  at the same time, he should also focus on family growth and try to maintain a balance between both roles.",7.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.939660,0,hf

In my opinion, this is a partly natural phenomenon that has been exacerbated by technology and the solutions lie in strict restriction and supervision.<NL><NL><NL><NL>The cause of a lack of concentration at school is both the pervasiveness of technology and human nature. Firstly, people have always struggled to focus. Very few pupils enjoy concentrating on tedious lessons and completing endless assignments at the department. However, this has become worse as corporations exploit fundamental human characteristics. Research has shown that the number of hours one spends on a laptop, smartphone, or tablet has a direct correlation with a shorter attention span. The reason for this is that technology supplies passive, immediate gratification. Therefore, schoolkids cannot focus because of a combination of human susceptibility and predatory consumer electronics companies.<NL><NL><NL><NL>The most feasible solutions are for parents and schools to monitor students strictly. This begins with parents. They must either approve or purchase a child their first smartphone or tablet and manage their early interactions with technology. Many parents consciously gift young children these devices to help them learn how to use technology and aid their cognitive development. By waiting until later in life to approve a smartphone or limiting daily screen time, this issue can be greatly mitigated from the onset. Schools also have a role to play as they must enforce strict rules banning the use of smartphones at institutions. For example, in many Asian countries, students' phones are confiscated if they are found using them during classes.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, a lack of focus at school is driven by human nature and modern technology, accordingly, parents and schools must work together to curb the worst excesses.

There are some reasons  why is this happening and also the solutions for them which will be discussed in this essay. <NL><NL><NL><NL>  The first reason for the absence of concentration are subjects that are taught in a monotonous way. In such case, kids get distracted by other things they bring to school from home. For instance, in our era of technology, even elementary school students have a phone or tablet where there are numerous apps and games. As a result, a child pulls the phone out of his pocket as soon as the lesson gets boring. The solution is for the teacher to engage students in different interactives to better grasp the topics. This method will decrease children’s interest in participating in discussion and hols their attention. <NL><NL><NL><NL>  Another reason is a teacher’s approach to everyone. Situations, when no attention is paid to some students, occur frequently and as a result, a kid starts doing anything but not listening to the pedagogue. However, if some kids can tell their parents about that type of accident, there are some who does not. Moreover, somebody can even believe it is normal behaviour for a teacher. For instance, some teachers can offend students because they do not meet the standards they imagine in their heads. To tackle this issue, the entire teaching staff ought to attend psychologist sessions before starting to work with children. <NL><NL><NL><NL>  In conclusion, both problems can be solved if the efforts are made, especially when a person likes the job and is ready to do anything to involve pupils in the process of education.",7.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.939706,0,hf

If children are exposed to a TV screen for an excessive amount of time, it will affect their eyesight problems and makes children’s bodies weak due to a lack of physical activities and leads children to a sedentary lifestyle. Not to mention, they can be at risk of certain diseases such as obesity. Additionally, the amount of time letting children watch TV can also negatively affect family relationships.

While there are some downsides to watching TV for children, I believe that children can learn a plethora of things by watching the right content on the television.<NL><NL>On the one hand, watching TV in excess can have detrimental effects on children. Firstly, watching television for long hours can make children physically feeble and it may affect their eyesight. Secondly, in today’s jet set age most of the families are nuclear and both of the parents are working, so it is possible for the children to get exposed to harmful / inappropriate content. For instance, there is adult content in every movie and sitcom nowadays and also film stars are seen drinking alcohol and doing drugs on television. This could have a detrimental effect on children.<NL><NL>On the other hand, watching TV can be beneficial for learning new things for the children, if they are allowed to watch for limited time and under the supervision of elders. I believe there are numerous channels such as Discovery, National Geographic and Animal Planet which telecast programmes that are educational and thus enhance a child’s cognitive skills. These types of channels broadcast episodes related to science in daily life, flora and fauna, and biodiversity. Children can learn a lot about nature by watching these on the television.<NL><NL>In conclusion, watching TV in excess can be detrimental for children, but I believe that it could be educational if seen if watched for a short amount of time under parental supervision.",7.0,2024-11-25 18:05:38.939892,0,hf

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In this day and age, gaining weight is a global problem. The increasing number of residents are becoming victims of obesity. Some people argue that to solve this situation, it is necessary to go up the expenditure of food which is high in fat.

I will shed light on my opinion in the following essay.<NL><NL><NL><NL>On the one hand, there is no denying that pricing fattening foods at a higher cost can demonstrate some effectiveness in reducing the risk of obesity. Firstly, when unhealthy food items become more expensive, people are more likely to reconsider their choices and seek out more nutritious options. For instance, if a bottle of sugary water costs more than a bottle of water, people will choose the latter, thereby reducing their calorie intake. Secondly, this price growth will motivate individuals to reduce the frequency and quantity of purchases, reducing overall consumption and thereby the likelihood of obesity.<NL><NL><NL><NL>On the other hand, other measures with far-reaching impacts should be given greater consideration. Nowadays, a large number of people are leading a sedentary lifestyle which is considered as one of the major reasons for obesity. Therefore, physical exercise plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy body. Besides, participating in counseling sessions with nutrition experts can provide valuable insights into a healthy and balanced diet. For example, by gradually transitioning from fat-heavy to more nourishing food options, individuals can make better-informed choices for their daily diet, leading to a significant decrease in obesity rates over the long run.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, it can be argued that while the rise in fattening food prices can be a viable solution to a certain extent, other measures still need to be taken to comprehensively reduce this obesity circumstance",7.0,2024-11-25 18:05:38.939909,0,hf

420359630742819237,Young people are often influenced in their behaviours and situations by others in the same age. This is called “peer pressure”. Do the disadvantages of peer pressure outweigh the advantages?,"It is quite common these days that the young are much influenced by peer pressure. It is my belief that the positive effects of this phenomenon could certainly offset its disadvantages. <NL><NL><NL><NL>There are several drawbacks to peer pressure. A common reason is that young people’s mentality is negatively affected, which can lead to worry or depression. In fact, working or studying with better students can make young people uncomfortable. For example, when I study in a class with a lot of classmates who learn much better than me, I feel very pressured and ashamed. Another negative aspect can be that the youth often feel uncomfortable with their appearance. This means that if peers just pay attention too much attention to appearance and make judgments, young people can feel uneasy and try to be as  fashionable as possible, which can be very costly.<NL><NL><NL><NL>However, in spite of these negative effects, peer pressure can bring about important benefits. One obvious advantage is that young people have opportunities and environments to develop themselves better. In fact, if young people are surrounded by good people, they can learn from them such as trying anything new or discovering new ideas to help them overcome some difficult problems. For example, my colleagues in my brother’s company work productively and solve problems quickly; therefore, my brother day by day works more effectively and productively, and he has just been promoted to manager. <NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, it’s common that young people are often influenced in their behaviours and situations by peers. While this can make them sometimes stressed, there can be a lot of benefits in helping young people to have  motivation to grow and succeed.",7.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.940122,0,hf
535143624144343374,"Some people think that employers should not care about the way their employees dress, because what matters is the quality of their work.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?","There is an opinion that employers should not overly concern themselves with what their employees wear, as their quality of work should be the primary focus. I wholeheartedly agree with this viewpoint, and this essay will elaborate on my reasons.<NL><NL><NL><NL>The major consideration for employers should indeed be the quality of their employees' work. When employers prioritize work performance over dress code, they create an environment where employees can focus on their tasks without unnecessary distractions. For example, in the tech industry, companies like Apple have adopted a more relaxed dress code, allowing employees to wear casual attire. This approach has contributed to a culture of innovation, where employees feel comfortable and empowered to generate groundbreaking ideas. By emphasizing work quality over attire, companies like Apple have demonstrated that allowing employees to dress comfortably can lead to enhanced creativity and productivity.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Furthermore, an excessive focus on dress codes can negatively impact inclusivity and diversity within the workplace. When employers impose strict dress codes, they may inadvertently exclude employees from various cultural backgrounds who have unique clothing preferences or requirements. For example, in multinational corporations with employees from diverse cultures, mandating a Western dress code might alienate those who prefer traditional attire. Embracing a more flexible dress code policy fosters an inclusive environment where employees from different cultural backgrounds feel respected and valued, contributing to a more harmonious and diverse workplace.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, employers should place their main focus on the quality of their employees' work rather than micromanaging their attire. As exemplified by companies like Apple and multinational corporations, this approach not only enhances work performance but also fosters an inclusive and diverse working environment.",6.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.940137,0,hf

Although I agree that people should dress formally in some professional settings, there is no one-size-fits-all answer for every industry.<NL><NL><NL><NL>On the one hand, professional attire plays a key role in certain professions, such as the hospitality industry, and healthcare sectors, to name but a few, which is considered a must for many jobs. For example, clients are able to recognize waiters or waitresses at a hotel by clothing, thus facilitating work procedures and saving time and effort. The uniform is also a norm among soldiers and police officers, which can not only make them easily identified but signalize the image of authority and trustworthiness. Furthermore, formal wear is usually required on some occasions to show our respect and professionalism to others. For instance, interviewees should put on office attire in the meeting, thereby impressing interviewers with professional attitudes. <NL><NL><NL><NL>On the other hand, the uniform may deprive us of creativity and the pursuit of freedom, which should not be de rigueur in all contexts. It is par for the course for employees working in high-tech companies to wear casually. After all, they do not need to serve customers face-to-face or present seriousness to others. More importantly, dress codes should not steal the show in the workplace, instead, they must place high emphasis on the work results. Furthermore, with the increasing number of people working at home and becoming self-employed, it is unnecessary to regulate subordinates what to wear at work. <NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, while business clothes should not reign supreme in all businesses, it is still the order of the day in many professions according to professional settings and requirements.",7.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.940150,0,hf

First, when attending to some intellectual subjects, namely chemistry or math, students are able to enhance their cognitive abilities. Some examples of this, particularly include the improvement of problem-solving skills like balancing chemical equations or addressing chemical reactions.

In my opinion, there are two key reasons behind this situation, and several solutions could be effective to deal with it. <NL><NL><NL><NL>Regarding the causes, it may come from  overpopulation and the breakthrough in technology which encourages people to travel more. The very first rationale is about the higher total of inhabitants in many areas around the globe. Indeed, the world population has reached eight billion citizens recently. The more humans, the more vehicles are needed. To satisfy their demand for travelling and commuting, people have a tendency to afford their own transport, such as a car or a motorbike, which allows them to move at their convenience. The growth in the number of vehicles  on roads, however, has been responsible for air and noise pollution in metropolises. For example, Dehli, one of the most inhabited megacities, is famous for not only its authentic traditions but also the poorest quality of air which is covered with overwhelming exhaust fumes from private transportation all year round. Another reason that needs consideration is the development of mobile technology. Such achievements make travelling much easier than ever before. Visiting a foreign city is now in hand thanks to the investment in air travel. Nevertheless, this  can cause some disruption and annoyance in the local areas where the airports are constructed. <NL><NL><NL><NL>The aforementioned issues may be addressed with two possible methods. First of all, there should be a nationwide regulation to control the number of childbirths. Like China, its one-child policy 20 years ago is now efficient to reduce and keep the number of its locals under supervision. Fewer car users have encouraged lower use of transport. Besides, public transport ought to receive more investment. The national budget can be spent to purchase more buses, build more railways and train more staff to meet the growing needs of travellers.

There are various measures that can prove effective in this regard.<NL><NL><NL><NL>The unpopularity of public transportation is one of the main reasons that is causing traffic jams and transportation problems in various metropolitan cities of the world. Either non-availability or substandard public transport encourages public to use their personal vehicles that results in traffic issues, particularly during peak hours.

Firstly, the most instantaneous results can be sought if the government encourages people to use public transport by making it more comfortable, convenient and cost effective. In other words, if the quality public transportation is made available to the citizens that is parallel to their personal cars in comfort, yet at a lower cost, can encourage people to prefer using public transport. For example, the public in the European countries prefers to use public transport rather than using one of their own because it is equally good and more affordable.<NL><NL><NL><NL> Secondly, another factor that can be of great value in the long term, is to minimize the traffic congestion is by constructing the alternate means of transit. Since cities are expanding due to urbanization, it has resulted in the shrinkage of roads that are not enough to meet the transport requirement of a relatively bigger population. Hence there is a need to build alternate roads, ring roads, subways or rail tracks to divert the influx and avoid traffic jams.

Unlike school, where there is often a structured timetable and close monitoring by teachers and parents, university students are expected to manage their own time, which can be a daunting task for those unaccustomed to this level of autonomy.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To address this issue, higher education institutions can adopt a range of strategies. One such approach is the implementation of comprehensive orientation programs designed to equip incoming students with essential study competencies, effective time management strategies, and awareness of available campus resources. Additionally, by creating smaller tutorial groups within larger classes, these institutes could provide students with a more conducive environment for asking questions and seeking clarification. Moreover, universities should promote a culture of open communication between professors and students, encouraging them to seek help when needed.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, the transition from high schools to tertiary education poses a significant academic challenge for students due to the differences in terms of curricula and greater independence required. By initiating specialized orientation programs, cultivating smaller learning communities, and advocating open channels of communication, universities can help students overcome these challenges and thrive in their academic pursuits.",7.0,2024-11-25 18:05:38.940600,0,hf

This phenomenon in fact becomes a hindrance for the students and makes their knowledge inequivalent to each other.

From my perspective, this tendency has raised many disruptive concerns relating to the issues of manipulating public opinion and fostering overshopping.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To begin with, the popularity of advertisements can form a negative perspective on daily activities. It is true that the high density of advertisements leads to memorable footage stuck in the audience's minds. This might have the impact of changing their mindset in the long-term whether they are exposed to too many of these advertisements. For example, people watching car advertisements usually recognize that the background of these tends to be decorated in a luxurious way leading to a mindset that only the high-order classes can buy them. Because the target audiences of car sellers are often the high-income people, however, it could be seen that advertisements release in the public eye.

Nevertheless, it is noticeable that this is a mistrustful idea and stereotype, and many forms of advertisements are manipulating the public to push their sales.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Furthermore, the high density has not only shifted people’s perspective  but also led to detrimental activities. Firstly, many advertisements promoting their items tend to constantly repeat not only on TV and smartphones  but also on billboards whether people going out, this would stick in customers’ memories and lead to a feeling of curiosity or fear of missing out. Therefore, trending products are usually hunted and attracted by a plethora of consumers. However, there are a variety of top trending products from several aspects of the market, leading to the customers’ tendency to splash all their money on them. It reckons that this is an expenditure habit and also harms the surrounding environment due to the high demands of producing too many items. Zara, a fashion brand, for example, is a well-known case of fast fashion.

This well-established truth would likely be more popularly embraced if marketing messages did not exaggerate the significance of physical appearance.<NL><NL><NL><NL>The consumerism caused by excessive advertising is another reason for my disapproval of its popularity. Marketers nowadays are armed with new customer insights and advanced technical tools to skillfully entice viewers into making impulsive purchases. To illustrate, TikTok has developed a detection feature that can constantly identify the preferences and hobbies of users based on their content search, subsequently prompting suitable buying suggestions that accurately trigger their temptation to buy these things. This has given rise to impulsive buying that consequently leads to not only personal debt but also excessive waste which contaminates the environment since more unwanted obsolete items would be discarded. It is a testament as to why advertising campaigns are detrimental at both individual and societal levels.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, the prevalence of advertisements appears to me as a disadvantage as they distort the audience’s view of life and breed overconsumption. That is why governments should issue more stringent laws to restrain the development of the advertising industry until the aforementioned issues are comprehensively addressed.",8.0,2024-11-25 18:05:38.940847,0,hf

As a couple progresses in life they should have greater financial resources to draw upon to support their children and reduce the negative impact on poverty.

As a result, children born at a later stage are less vulnerable to the negative consequences of divorce and family break up which are less common in older pairings.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Although the positive aspects appear to have great strength, there are also significant negative factors to consider. Foremost, as people age, they suffer from a greater amount of genetic degradation which can increase the chances of having a child with a genetic defect such as Down's syndrome. Another factor which can have a detrimental effect on a child’s quality of growth is the fact that older people tend to have less energy which means they are less able to cope with and raise their relatively more energetic young child. Moreso, there is also a generation gap in terms of relatability. As the age gap between the child and the parents increases their ability to relate to each other and share the same ideas about life could be placed under severe pressure. This may have negative consequences on the child’s upbringing and development.

For instance, a student who just passed out with his doctorate degree at the year of 29 and gets married at the youth of 31 has very little time to settle in his career and go for family planning.

Firstly, in many countries, both men and women have an opportunity to make a career and become a well-paid employee.

Secondly, there are those who want to be more mentally prepared for having a toddler.

Why?<NL><NL>Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?,"In the modern world, it is observed by some authorities and politicians that people have been preferring to be a parent later mid-ages when compared to the past. Economic reasons and career ambition have caused that the people postponed having a child. I believe that having a child in later age has more advantages not only individuals but also for society.<NL><NL>First of all, the human population has been increasing rapidly for a long time. Due to the locations’ high density, the living cost has increased suddenly. Moreover, the cost of having a baby is extremely high. So, most of the couples have decided to birth a child after they stabilize their economic power. On the other hand, especially after the idea of liberalism have been spreading all over the world since 1980, people have become more selfish and only focused on their career. For instance, if a woman has a baby at 30 years old, which is the most important age for her career, she has to pause her career for a minimum of 2 years.<NL><NL>High population in big cities mostly decreases the quality of the education system.

Firstly, it enables one to be fully ready for the responsibilities that come with having children. This means that when people delay giving birth till their later age, by then they would have been well established financially, morally and education wise. The reality is that people who give birth early are not yet ready for the consequent duty of care. This difference can be seen when comparing  children education between the American and the Nigerian. Early child birth has made many Nigerian unable to afford their kids' education, whereas, the American which mostly give birth at later age have highest level of children education. It can, therefore, be logically deduced that giving birth at later life prepares one for the task of caring for them. Secondly, giving birth at later age helps to control population rate. If people start having kids at young age, they tend to have many kids before menopause, hence delaying child birth will help individual family to give birth to fewer children.<NL><NL>Despite the numerous benefits of giving birth at later life, it however, has some few drawbacks. First of it is the reduced chances of conception. Scientists have shown that the best chance of conception is between the age of 18 years to 28 years and the chances keep decreasing with age. This means that people who decide to wait till later age risk not having kids at all. Furthermore, delaying child birth could also result in certain complications during labour and delivery.

In particular, physical education teachers always try to introduce the students to the beautiful world of  cooperative activities by explaining the rules of each sport and then letting them practise in the field. For example, in  practice, they need to organise into two teams and play soccer when they have to pass the ball to score, they need to trust and know each other in order to improvise with the ball. It is a fact that children adore playing and doing exercise, so why not use it to help them to improve their collaborative skills?<NL><NL><NL><NL>In addition to this, teachers can motivate children to compete in regional tournaments where they need to strengthen their relationships to create a strong group and to improve human values like cooperation and respect.

Teamwork through different activities and sports was implemented, and even the families were involved in organising meals and supporting their children. There is no doubt that the kids were highly motivated and really enjoyed the tournament.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, teaching sports at school, where pupils can learn how to organise themselves in the field like a team and get motivated to participate in scholar competitions would contribute to making a huge change in their attitude and the manner in which they interact with each other.

First of all, governments are responsible for the quality and safety of food in the market, they could introduce strict laws to make sure that public heath will not be damaged by polluted or expired food. Moreover, using unauthorized chemicals, selling unhygienic and low-quality food should be forbidden by the government. For example, eating fast food may lead to severe diseases such as increase in blood cholesterol, raise blood pressure and obesity.

Although this problem can be attributed to a great number of reasons, some feasible solutions can be considered to address this.<NL><NL><NL><NL>There are a number of reasons for this adverse tendency. The first reason for the rise in the amount of food waste is the increased supply of cheap and readily available food, which encourages people to buy more than they really need. For example, in order to increase sale revenue as well as compete with other brands, many fast-food restaurants nowadays have launched plenty of promotion programs such as “By 2 get 1 free”, which has attracted hundreds of customers and thus the huge amount of food waste will end up in landfills. Another reason is that in order to deal with busy lifestyles, people tend to buy food for the whole week rather than go to the supermarket on a daily basis. However, some kinds of fruits and vegetables easily become rotten within a few days and then thrown away.<NL><NL><NL><NL>A wide range of strong measures must be implemented, not only by the government but also by individuals, to combat food waste. This first solution is that the government can develop some action plans to raise consumers’ awareness of food appreciation. This could be done by getting people involved in global food campaigns such as Think.Eat.Save and anti-food waste campaign, helping their citizens to become more conscious consumers and when everyone is fully aware of this, they would think more carefully when it comes to shopping for food.

Despite a few problems, such as plastic production and the absence of recycling, I reckon that the decision of the raising prices for fuel is definitely the best way to prevent the worldwide catastrophe.<NL><NL><NL><NL>On one hand, the main environmental issue of global warming is caused by two significant factors, which are burning fossil fuels and deforestation. Firstly, expensive fuel could actually decrease a number of cars bought by people due to the fact of economic purposes.

Some individuals believe that the most effective way to deal with worldwide ecological difficulties is to raise the price of fuel. However, I am of the opinion that it will benefit the society to some extent only, which will be discussed in the following paragraphs.<NL>Increase in price of fuel will limit the personal transport of an individual to some levels and commuters will find other alternatives to travel on daily basic such as public transport or electric vehicles. Majorly the middle class families will be effected with this step and persuade them to follow local city transport in the sake of controlling pollution. Recently, in Delhi, the government took initiatives to control the personal vehicle on road by charging double amount on petrol purchase for own carriers, thus the output was quite effective and number of vehicles drop down approximately 80 percent from the service roads. <NL>However, on the other hand, the major contributors of air pollution are the airplanes. In that case lowering the price will not impact much as air travelling is carried by mostly rich people and it is part of luxury. People who prefer travelling by air as compare to road are always keeping the time limit as priority instead of money. Hence, increasing price will not lower the usage of air transport. Thus, we need to look for an alternative solution to minimize the pollution hazard. <NL>In conclusion, increasing price of fuel will profit the community in terms of limiting usage of personal conveyance, but for some who choose time as the limit instead of money will not be effected with this idea.

With the rapid growth of the internet and smartphones, listening to music has become easier than ever. Instead of having to attend concerts, listeners can just plug their headphones into a smartphone and listen to music online. While this has its fair share of benefits, record labels have been hesitant to expand into the online music industry since it has various drawbacks, including piracy issues and monetization. In this essay, I will discuss the aforementioned issues as well as giving my own opinion.<NL><NL><NL><NL>On one hand, the explosive growth of online music websites has made it exponentially harder for record labels and artists to control and monetize their work. These people are concerned that as the internet music industry grows, so do the piracy issues. This may cause everyone to copy each other, making music seem unoriginal and uninterested. It can also discourage artists to produce and release music, as there are no ways for them to ensure that their music is being used as they intended as well as controlling where their works are being published. Overall, illegal Internet downloads can have negative effects on the artists and the music industry as a whole.<NL><NL><NL><NL>On the other hand, having the ability to publish music on the internet - where millions of users are actively using and discussing every day - has helped new artists get discovered and grow. Moreover, the growth of music piracy has pushed streaming platforms to take extra steps to prevent illegal downloads. It's not hard to understand why in the early 2000s, record labels and artists were trying to take down music streaming platforms that were allowing users to download music freely and distribute it wherever they please. The most notable case of this is perhaps Napster, as this platform was taken down after a huge wave of protests to protect the rights of composers. Because of this, most streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music include features that help artists control their music distribution and monetization. Therefore, it's almost impossible to pirate music now, unlike in the 2000s. <NL><NL><NL><NL>To summarize, illegal Internet downloads can and have caused a ton of issues regarding piracy and monetization, but they helped push the development of tools to ensure these issues never happen again.

Many regard that the rise in economic and traditional diversity of one nation possess beneficial impacts upon others. However, some object to this idea because of the visible possibility that indigenous values may be perished. <NL><NL><NL><NL>        To begin with, numerous developing countries have been experiencing a rise in employment opportunity and a massive economic gains with regard to globalisation. The modern business has now found its capability to approach customers of oversea countries. To clearly explain this, companies possess a greater chance to have their products increased in sales numbers and to modify their items to become more approachable and more versatile. Furthermore, the cultural relationships among countries allow employees to go abroad and learn more new things about their neighbours. For example, the Americans usually take trips to Vietnam to experience a wide variety of exclusive foods and learn about the history of their past rival. These people exploit this prospect to improve their foreign foods’ quality, especially Pho and to enhance USA’s historical educational quality.<NL><NL><NL><NL>       However wonderful the advantages may be, foreign policies may terminate a country’s exclusiveness. Globalization has provided a more diverse world in terms of culture’s quantity. One culture may become dominating and make others disappear. Once the culture of a region completely vanishes, it will reverse the merits which globalization evokes. For instance, if Vietnam’s indigenous food like Pho disappears, the amount of international tourists will disappear. Therefore, the tourism industry in Vietnam will fall into chaos and thereby downgrading the whole economic system.<NL><NL><NL><NL>     In conclusion, though globalisation may benefit countries in terms of the economy, those countries, neglecting its policies about such progress might one day disappear completely off the world map.

In this essay, I will examine both sides of the argument, as well as give my view.<NL><NL><NL><NL>As for those who believe the benefits to take a handful of responsibilities of children, there are many reasons. Firstly, there is no doubt that youngsters need to be well taught and guided before their growing up and entering their adulthood. Taking more duties would allow them to understand early about the real meaning of it, which will, in turn, prepare them well ahead to be a reliable and responsible person when they turn to adult lives. Moreover, a responsible child in a family also means that they would share some family obligations, hence preparing them to be a great leader or a team player.  <NL><NL><NL><NL>In contrast, other people hold the notion that early responsible child life is harmful to children. For instance, children may appear too young to understand what it takes when comes to responsibility, which may well be added the stress to them, resulting in unnecessarily worrisome and hopeless, which would negatively impact children’s mental development. Besides, they may be able to partially finish the assigned tasks. This might be interpreted as a failure or partial completion, which would cost a shadow in their young minds affecting their later lives. The irony is that they would be less capable of taking responsibilities when they grow up. <NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, although there are some negative implications, I believe that the positive aspects of children taking responsibility are overweight the negative ones; it would prepare them well to be a responsible person in adulthood.",7.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.942060,0,hf

However, I support the former statement as I strongly believe that the new technological innovation is the paramount reason for creating such differences among people.<NL><NL><NL><NL> To commence with, technological advancements have drastically changed the world we live in and made our life much more pragmatic than we ever anticipated. Although most of these gadgets are eye catching, most of them are very expensive. Therefore, only affluent population can buy them and those in destitute cannot. For example, in the developing countries, only a few percent of the population can buy iPads, iPhones, mac book, expensive cameras and many more. Not only this, many cannot even afford basic household appliances. They have to perform everything manually. This shows the disparity in the living standard between rich and poor people, which creates imbalances and have detrimental effect. <NL><NL><NL><NL>From the other perspective, with these advancements, internet has become relatively cheaper. Thus, with the help of different social media platform, the general population can virtually connect and interact with each other. With time, they may develop a bond and friendship.

While some argue that this trend might be harmful to children, others have an opposing idea. Nevertheless, my opinion lies with the latter.<NL><NL><NL><NL>On the one hand, travelling abroad to find a job can harm children in several ways. Firstly, it  may affect children's languages.

The impact would be more prominent when children try simultaneously to learn their first language. Secondly, children would copy the natives' lifestyles, norms and habits, which might not be acceptable based on their original religion.

In my opinion, I would argue that competitive sports should not be allowed at schools as they may bring many drawbacks to children.<NL><NL>It is a belief that competitive sports bring many advantages for children in the future. First, competition is a natural instinct in humans, and it is likely to strengthen children’s personalities. Therefore, competition is healthy because it pushes people to give their best or even over their limitation. Second, children need to experience these competitions at schools. This is due to the fact that when they graduate from schools, they have to step into the real world where people have to compete with one another to get jobs in daily life.<NL><NL>On the other hand, the negative effects of competitive sports should not be overlooked. The first reason is that sports should provide children with a sense of enjoyment rather than competition. Addionally, playing sports with their peers can build their relationships and teamwork skills. If competitive sports are brought to the curriculum, their relationships will be disjointed and fragmented. Another consideration is that playing sports encourages children to have physical and mental development, meaning that they become healthier and may have fewer diseases, such as diabetes.

For instance, in some Thai schools, teachers haven't provided a gap for pupils to ask questions, so they just talk until the end of the lesson. As a result, the pupils don't understand anything, and finally they got a low grade on the exams. Furthermore, encouraging students to express things would aid education places finding some inferior points they would miss.

Additionally, campaigns about being healthy in society can encourage people to spend more time on exercise and eat some healthy food.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, technological development provides information about the health of people which encourages people to do more exercise and cook healthy food conveniently.

Some people think having a younger leader would be better.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"Commonly speaking, heads of institutions are older members of society. According to some people's opinion younger administrators would influence the management system in a better way. I am inclined to agree with both of the ideas for a number of convincing reasons.<NL><NL><NL><NL>The first idea set out can be true for two solid reasons I am about to explain. Since the beginning of humanity elderly people are always respected and almost every idea, they put forward were always supported without any doubt. The second reason, based on a stereotype, is that older members of public are seen as more experienced and omniscient individuals, hence directors of associations, enterprises often found to be older people.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Regarding the second idea that is claimed, I utterly agree that well-educated younger people would make a better leader as they are full of energy, open to endeavor new management techniques for the best of their workplace. For instance, young ambitious worker would go through sleepless nights to create a project that can benefit to the company and their career and that can be realised thanks to their robust health. In my view, this derives from the urge to prove themselves in society as a prosperous young leader.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To sum up, I am in agreement with the opinion that chiefs of people in organizations are generally older people due to their work experience and reputation they collected over the years.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is argued by some that giving power to young people to lead organizations can be more beneficial than letting older people be in charge of leadership. I totally agree with this view because of the following reasons.<NL><NL><NL><NL>I hold a firm belief that younger people can bring many benefits to the development of an organization when they become leaders or managers. First of all, compared with senior people who often suffer from health problems, young people have a competitive edge in terms of youth and physical strength. This means that they are willing to sacrifice time, effort and devotion to work longer hours or build a reputation for their business, which old leaders may find  beyond their ability to do. Besides, with  sensitivity and quick adaptation to changes in the market, young leaders seem to be brave enough to take risks and materialize innovative initiatives. With these differences, young people can lead their organization to a higher level of status and competitiveness in the market.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Some people argue that it would be better for an organization when its leaders or managers are older people. The reason for this argument is because those people are very experienced, which means that they can have a wide vision as well as abilities to predict unexpected setbacks. Thanks to accumulated experience, elderly leaders can orientate their businesses to overcome tough times and gain sustainable development. However, I am more convinced that young people are able to do better than these old directors in a constantly-changing world these days. In fact, the more experienced people are, the more conservative they become. In other words, the conservative nature of elderly seniors can be considered as a hurdle for their adaptation to continuous turbulence in the business practice, hindering the breakthroughs of an organization.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, due to the aforementioned reasons in terms of youth and risk-taking nature, young people deserve to be held accountable for leading an organization or a business rather than older ones.",7.0,2024-11-25 18:05:38.942320,0,hf

In the following paragraph, both of these viewpoints will be discussed in detail before the conclusion is reached.<NL><NL><NL><NL>On the one hand, one of the reasons that folk say that research should focus on handling health problems is that these days, there are numerous new illnesses emerging all the time. To illustrate, Covid-19 that is spreading out currently is a disease that humans have not known before. As a result, we have to do research to invent the vaccine to deal with this disease. Moreover, individuals would like to have a longer life. In other words, at present, the average lifetime of humans is seventy years old. Therefore, If medicines and medical treatments are more enhanced, humans will have a longer life.<NL><NL><NL><NL>On the other hand, the obvious reason that some people believe that there are more crucial problems is that presently, there are a lot of environmental threats that affect our lives.

On top of that, engineering issue also plays an important role in our lives.

880638895688169102,Fewer young people choose to work in farming. What are the reasons? Should young people be encouraged to do farming work?,"At present, the question of why fewer farms for their livelihoods in the countryside remains a conundrum. I will give my own points about the causes of this trend and whether it is good for youngsters to work in farming.<NL><NL><NL><NL>   Firstly, fewer people do farming jobs in rural areas because those involved are usually underpaid. Consequently, it becomes a real hurdle to lead their family to a happy life while living  a low standard. Everyone desires to have tasty meals, to live in gorgeous houses, to send their kid to well-reputed schools so they would never accept such a low wage . Secondly, extreme working conditions are another burden that people have to take on. For example, when it is in the middle of June, farmers are still in the fields on a daily basis although the weather is rainy which is detrimental to endure. In contrast, even an office worker can get a higher air-conditioned working complex. In other words, this profession is the last choice and people avoid it because making a living seems to be impossible.<NL><NL><NL><NL>    Those above-mentioned pieces of evidence show that there are a lot more well-paid careers for people to choose if they leave the remote area to study in the city. Such as doctors, architecture designers, and other rewarding roles, so I strongly disagree to let  youngsters work in the profession of cultivating. Moreover, if students become farmers, they will waste all the time and money that they spent on academic education because watering and collecting do not need high level of qualification but health, all of their accomplishments at school are unusable then. For instance, unlike farmers, well-educated IT developers can earn much more in a month. In addition, those people also have the  right to experience other perks such as being flexible in working schedules, which farmers could never have .<NL><NL><NL><NL>   In conclusion, there are a few key reasons for the decreasingly attendance to the work that provides agriculture products being little amount of pay and a poor working environment.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"It is widely believed that people should put blame on the parents of those who break the rules. Nevertheless, from my perspective, exerting punishment on parents for their children's wrongdoing is not sensible for a variety of reasons.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To begin with, every individual should be responsible for their own actions. Although fathers and mothers have to take accountability for their children's mistakes in some aspects, the youngsters need to deal with the problems they had caused because each person is a separate individual who has their own thoughts and deeds. Hence, it is morally wrong to blame all the responsibilities on moms and dads. Besides, if parents are in charge of the faults that their children cause, the youngsters will rely on their parents and are not willing to face worthy penalties.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Furthermore, adolescents are influenced by not only their parental behaviours but also other vital factors such as their peers and toxic content on the Internet. In the tech savvy-era, the popularity of social media boosts the anti-social and harmful videos that cause plenty of consequences that fathers and mothers could not control. Those who have curiosities could mimic these criminal activities that they do not have full awareness of. Another reasonable factor that should be concerned is the teenagers' social relationships at school. Friendship plays a crucial role and affects directly children's behaviours and actions. For example, as reported in Times in 2020, there are more than half of teenagers' crimes have the potential root of obeying peers' actions. <NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, although maternal individuals are the core model and the protectors of their offspring, I am of the opinion that it is unreasonable to accuse them of their children's faulty actions.",7.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.942389,0,hf

While studies show that people in developing countries are happier now than before, people in developed countries are no happier than they were before.","Money cannot guarantee people's happiness. It is proved by experts that although economic growth has made people richer, people from developed countries feel less happy than they were before. In contrast, in poor countries, wealth make them happier. I will outline the reason why this phenomenon happened.<NL><NL>In the case of developed countries, they are never starving. In the past, they can found meal everywhere and able to bought it. Before technology advanced, they already went to work such as farming or work in a factory. They had enough money to prevent them from starving. Another reason is the time of working. They worked several hours and have time to take a rest. Meanwhile, in recent year, they work overlap time hours. They have no time to do their interest or go on vacations with their family. It is because of competition among people. Their ambition encourages them to pursue their goal and achievement for enhancing their status.<NL><NL>On the other hand, residents of developing countries feel happier than they were before because they ever lived in a lack of education and food. In the past, it was really hard for them to buy some food and studied in formal education. But today, since they are richer than before, they can get both of those terms. They can buy an important stuff for their life. Another reason is they can manage their time working well, so they still have time to interact with other people.<NL><NL>In conclusion, I must say that what we can learn about two cases above is to love our life.

544525169229303236,The only way to improve road safety is to give much stricter punishments on driving offenses. <NL><NL><NL><NL>To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is currently a debate about whether imposing stricter penalties on inappropriate drivers is the sole solution to promoting road safety. I strongly disagree with this statement because, in my view, road safety depends not only on the severity of punishments but also on effective traffic rule enforcement and heightened public awareness.<NL><NL><NL><NL>One compelling reason why I argue that traffic rules play a pivotal role in addressing this issue is that rules form the fundamental framework that shapes societal behavior. Moreover, stringent traffic laws can deter drivers from engaging in dangerous behaviors on the road, thereby fostering a safer driving environment. To illustrate, individuals contemplating driving home after consuming alcoholic beverages, which could lead to accidents, are more likely to reconsider their actions when faced with the consequences outlined in traffic laws. Consequently, rules are instrumental in preventing potentially hazardous situations.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Another key factor supporting my stance is the importance of individual awareness and responsibility in ensuring road safety. Despite the existence of stringent penalties in traffic laws, some individuals continue to flout them. By educating drivers about these laws and cultivating a mindset of respect for fellow citizens on the road, we can significantly improve driver behavior. For example, a well-informed driver with a positive attitude toward road safety is more likely to become a responsible and law-abiding motorist, thereby contributing to a safer traffic environment. Therefore, encouraging a collective commitment to safe driving is paramount in enhancing road safety.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, I firmly believe that achieving road safety requires more than just imposing harsher penalties on offenders. It necessitates a multifaceted approach that includes effective traffic rule enforcement and the cultivation of public awareness and responsibility.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is a lot of discussion on how to improve security on our roads. Some people think that in order to decrease  the number of accidents there should be stricter punishments for driving offences. Although this might help, I believe that the impact would be minimal. I firmly believe that to increase safety on our commute there should be better planning on how they construct the roads and also in public transportation availability, in this essay I will point out the reasons and examples for my opinion.<NL><NL><NL><NL>First, hefty fines do not always work, one example is how Brazil increased the punishment for drunk driving, increasing the value of the fine and also making it a crime. But this had the initial effect of decreasing the number of driving under influence related accidents, however, over time drivers grew accustomed to it and rates came back to the same levels as before. Also, most municipalities do not have enough resources to diverge to this kind of inspection, making the punishment not as believable.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Secondly, the construction of  roads has a huge impact on how individuals drive. As an example, large lanes might bring a feeling of security to the driver and they might drive with less awareness and not check their speed as often. Therefore, roads that also are made to share the space with cars and pedestrians might have a huge influence on the number of accidents.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Lastly, there are other mechanisms of traffic control and security, that are more effective and cheaper than fines. One of the main ones is investing in public transportation. Taking people out of the cars and making them use public buses or trains put more professional drivers on the road and remove more aloof from the roads,  thus decreasing the risk of accidents.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, although stricter punishments might look like a good solution, they would have an effect only in the short run.

TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU AGREE OR DİSAGREE?,"In the last few years, the debate regarding road safety has been raised. Some people claim that the only way to increase  road security is to have strict rules and punishment systems. However, I believe that such measures will not be enough and we need more actions to tackle this problem. <NL><NL><NL><NL>Firstly, the government should have the responsibility for ensuring that the country has a safe route according to the standards. For example, in the major cities, we should have huge roads then small network routes. In addition, roadway maintenance should occur frequently in order to avoid accidents. Furthermore, we should have a national roads safety committee that will inspect and standardize the traffic safety issues. For instance, the committee will give guidelines to be followed as well as training to the inspectors to monitor the progress. <NL><NL><NL><NL>Secondly, the government also needs to make clear traffic rules and distribute them to the people. In other words,  theoretical knowledge should be included in driving lessons. In addition, such knowledge should be distributed to all roads users. Thirdly, the presence of traffic lights is essential to allow smooth movements of the vehicles. All of that together with a strict punishment system will decrease  accidents and promote roads safety. <NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, to decrease the accidents and make sure the security of motor traffic, cyclists and pedestrians we should have excellent roads as well as a formal committee that responsible for the guidelines.

Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?,"There is a widespread belief that voluntary community work should be mandatory for young individuals.  Although charity work does provide some value, I am more convinced that forcing them to take part in these activities is rather unfair.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To begin with the positives, a crucial advantage of unpaid services is that they inculcate a high sense of responsibility towards the community among teenagers. Indeed, without involving in charitable organizations, they miss the chance to experience and gain insight into the underprivileged in real life. As a result, they would not propose adequate solutions to solve these social problems in the future. Furthermore, a volunteer program is a chance for youngsters to develop various skills, which can be seen as a beneficial asset for their resumes. For instance, their communication and teamwork skills can be improved when they collaborate with friends to help the elder or orphans.<NL><NL><NL><NL>However, there are still some disadvantages when forcing young people to take part in unpaid jobs. Firstly, the time devoted to community services can be time-consuming. Undoubtedly, students have to set aside their studying time to join these activities. The second drawback is that if this policy is mandatory, it can pose a stressor for the young generation. Besides studying, most of them already have multiple responsibilities to tend to, like developing their own project, working part-time, or implementing the activities of their club. Adding public service as an obligation will make them feel being stripped of their freedom.

This essay will argue that eventually, most jobs will indeed be done by robots powered by artificial intelligence although not all jobs as believed by some.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Around the world, giant strides have been made with regards to the capacity of artificial intelligent robots to carry out complex tasks typically done by humans in industries like manufacturing, shipping and information technology. These robots are consistently demonstrating higher efficiency levels with cheaper overhead costs than their human counterparts, causing many industry leaders to cut down on their human workforce in favour of adopting robotic systems. For example, Tesla, the global leader in electric vehicle manufacturing, recently announced plans to lay off 20% of its workforce as well as plans to build two new factories across North America that will be fully operated using robots powered by artificial intelligence. Many more of such announcements are expected in the coming decades, corroborating the belief that human beings will be made redundant as more artificially intelligent robots replace them at their jobs. <NL><NL><NL><NL>However, not all occupations can be efficiently done by these robots. Professions such as prostitution, policing, marketing and customer service require human factors such as empathy and emotions to be delivered efficiently.

This issue has been a depressing magnitude. Although a plethora of reasons are there yet some sensible solutions are also available to curb this grave issue.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To commence with  the first and foremost cause,  is a lack of professionalism because colleges  do not teach pupils about the value of being well-behaved at job interviews. Moreover, teachers in educational institutes focus on covering the topics in the syllabus and train students to achieve good grades . Undoubtedly,  a number of learners graduate from top universities  with excellent grades. However, they end up being unemployed due to a lack of knowledge about job opportunities, interview criteria and resumes. To illustrate, in developed nations, multinational companies recruit candidates based on their resumes, interviews and experience in the past and according to a survey majority of people are not called in for hiring events because of the unprofessional format used to make resumes. Hence, being a bookworm is not worth it as communication skills and a number of other personality traits can help to achieve  a reputable position.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Moving toward the ideas that can curb this issue, the best solution to this problem is to make it compulsory for educational institutes to introduce a course in the graduation program in which students will be taught about the proper format of making resumes.

In fact, if it is not always pleasant to work, it is much less enjoyable when it is due during nights, bank holidays or weekends. While ordinary employees have the chance to spend festive moments with friends and relatives, healthcare workers, to give an example, are going to the hospital. Year after year, these missed precious moments contribute to a potential burn-out. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that working at night alters the circadian rhythm, which has negative consequences on the physical and psychological sphere. To conclude, these are just a few of the innumerable concerns shift workers have to deal with.<NL><NL><NL><NL>On the other hand, there are different solutions to at least sweeten shift-workers'workers conditions. For instance, an economic incentive should be given to them, especially when considering weekends and bank holidays. In addition, the number of wards should be limited following the guidelines written by the Society of occupational medicine. Finally, extra days off should be guaranteed, in order for workers to spend a proper amount of time with families and friends while they are not sleeping, as well as to profit from daylight to accomplish ordinary tasks. Perhaps, with those suggestions they might cherish their employment a bit more. <NL><NL><NL><NL>To conclude, there are countless cons to working during shifts. However, there are luckily a bunch of options, alternatives and ideas to ameliorate the condition of this essential class of workers.",6.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.942528,0,hf
68967749593462647,Q:  SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT EVENTUALLY ALL JOBS WILL BE DONE BY ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT ROBOTS.<NL><NL><NL><NL>WHAT IS YOUR OPINION?,"These days with the advent of new technologies such as AI, a lot of people have lost their businesses and have been replaced by them. Someone may say that this process will continue, resulting in the loose of all the jobs. While others say that there are professions that only living humans can do. I agree with the latter opinion and process this view in this essay. <NL><NL><NL><NL> Most importantly, professions dealing with feelings are difficult to be managed by AI. It is a privilege for human beings to be moved, shocked or angry and needless to say, those emotions can not be understood by artificially made things. For example, jobs such as mental counsellors can not be replaced. This is because there are no patterns or concrete solutions that can be applied to a mental problem. Problems regarding sentiments are always different and so the solutions are uncountable like stars. It is impossible for AI to deal with it using a pattern programmed previously. <NL><NL><NL><NL> On the other hand, someone may say that if we give all the accumulated information about a job, AI will be able to run the work. I agree to some extent but the more jobs AI steals, the more works people will nurture. AI is special in that it can use effectively all the past information. However, it is unable to make new things because it lacks creativity. Therefore, only humans are able to make innovations and innovative jobs can not be replaced by humans. <NL><NL><NL><NL> In conclusion, AI will never replace all jobs because it can not understand feelings and give birth to innovations.",7.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.942541,0,hf

Robots possibly can take most of the jobs; however, it is highly unlikely that occupations that require human contact can be substituted. This essay will discuss, why most of the jobs will be automated and only a few will be carried out by humans.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Automation is becoming increasingly prevalent and is likely to have a significant impact on the labour jobs market that does not require specific and complex human skills. Many companies will turn to artificial intelligence to automate processes and increase  efficiency as it is far less expensive than hiring, training and employing a human. For example, in many countries car wash stations have been automated that cost far less than employees. In addition, these stations work around the clock and require no vacations or holiday pay. For these reasons, occupations that can be automated will be replaced.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Conversely, there are some occupations that require a human touch and for this ,reason can not be replaced by artificial intelligence. These jobs include education, medicine, psychology and social work to name but a few. Robots will never be able to achieve the social and emotional capabilities that are required to perform these jobs.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To conclude, a significant number of human jobs will be conducted by robots in the future. While robots can take over the labour market jobs , occupations that require human skills will always exist.

165491823306637243,Some believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?,"In all countries around the globe armed police personnel are common. However, the necessity of arming them is debatable. Some people claim that it leads to the unprecedented attack on common people and perhaps to state terrorism and violence, while I concur with the side of those who argue that it is essential to maintain law and order. The reasons are manifold for my support  will be discussed in this essay. <NL><NL><NL><NL>On the one hand, I totally disagree with the notion that state terrorism is raising because of armed police officers. In fact, many people who believe this notion are not ready to understand the fact that the police department is directly controlled by the home department of government. And thus there are myriad public councils are working to strictly monitor the judicial use of these weapons by police officers. Additionally, these people often come with an example of some random police encounters with common people. Although these incidents are true, I believe these are mostly accidental and the police officers who are responsible for these also have been punished severely for their negligence. <NL><NL><NL><NL>On the other hand, the country's entire internal security management is under the control of the police department. In order to maintain these superiorly, they are in the need to develop some sort of fear among people. This fear in my opinion is healthy for the betterment of society. Furthermore, police and state security forces are the first-line workers who need to witness some dangerous situations. Despite their personal well-being, they work towards the welfare and security of the people. For example, recently one of the police inspectors in my neighbourhood was brutally attacked by some petty thieves during a situation when he tried to arrest them for shoplifting. This incident made me  think in favour of armed police officers that if he was allowed to carry his weapon, he would have got prevented  the attack. <NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, not only do armed police officers use their weapons to maintain law and order, but also for their self-protection. Therefore, I totally agree that arming  police officers will never lead to state terrorism or violence, in fact, it prevents these.",7.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.942569,0,hf

358282657366087741,"Many university graduates cannot find a job in their chosen profession. <NL>What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, <NL>should be done about it?","Nowadays we are facing the issue that a great total of graduates are completing their studies and becoming skilled but there are not many opportunities for them to get themselves involved in relevant jobs. This can be addressed by some important factors such as difficult environments and the poor infrastructure of industries. These can be solved by introducing some solutions like making the system more decorated and so on.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To begin with, one of the most deleterious factors is nepotism. We can see in most cases that recruitment has been taken by the control of the people who always try to select those candidates who are known to them, although it is required to choose  skilled  applicants. For instance, the managing director of a company has the power to impact the employee selection process so if he wants to keep that person who is very familiar to him then there should remain nothing to do with him. Another factor regarding this issue is that there could be less total of vacancies in the job market. Sometimes the balance between the total of grads and the required employee gets missing. For example, especially in under-developing countries, the control of the number of alumni versus post vacancies is very fickle. The university produces a greater number of graduates than the industries need. That causes highly skilled alumni to become unemployed.<NL><NL><NL><NL>So, the authorities have to take  responsibility to counter these issues. One solution could be for the appointing system must have to be non-partial and authentic so that only eligible ones could have the chance to get shortlisted. Suppose in the interview, the interviewer should check the actual ability of the candidate, not his family status. On top of that, the industries are needed to expand, which will cause a great number of job fields. The company may collaborate with the research departments of the universities which will help a lot in introducing new products or methods in their working fields. <NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, there are some pressing factors in the unemployment of  highly qualified graduates for example, partiality in the job opportunity or imperfect management of developing working areas. The government can obtain some solutions like making a fair interviewing panel or spreading out the job field in such a way that the grads get the capability to prove themselves.",6.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.942594,0,hf

What’s your opinion about it?","Nowadays, more and more women are working in plants, firms and industrial sites where only men  are used to be employed. Women are now more ambiguous and competing with men. This essay will explore reasons  why women are taking places occupied by men and at the end of the essay will underline my opinion.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Firstly, the reason is that there are so many single women pursuing their careers instead of building families. This could create competitive women who are eager for career development instead of building healthy relationships.For instance, compared to married women single one will wish for high-paid jobs and career opportunities because the only passion of not married women is their job opportunities.Thus that is why men are being replaced by females in job places.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Secondly, there are so many lonely mothers who give upbringing to their offspring. Consequently, they need more prospective job positions with high salaries since not everything is affordable nowadays because of high-cost products.For example , in order to afford a good education and food supply for their kids' parents should earn more money. Thus, women are taking any positions even men needed positions because it gives them the opportunity for earning high wages.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To conclude, it is true that women are taking men's traditional workplaces. In our contemporary community , the world it is common that women and men are on the same level. In my opinion, women should know their limitations and never compete with men because men are considered to be the chief of the family.

Some people, however, may argue and discourage students from doing so. I will discuss both  views in this essay but personally, I believe that youngsters must find part-time jobs which will help them in long term.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To begin with, those who do not favour students in applying for half-time placement states their reason that freshmen should concentrate on their studies and complete their degree with distinction. They think that getting involved in work at this stage will create unnecessary extra pressure that will lead to low grades in college or university. Moreover, they think that this time can be utilized more on exam preparations required for higher studies. For example, undergraduates in their final year usually do not opt for any internships and exploit their time in preparing for MBA and master’s exams. Hence, for these reasons, some individuals do not encourage pupils to work.<NL><NL><NL><NL>On the other hand, part-time jobs offer lots of advantages to younglings. Firstly, they can apply their theoretical knowledge and gain immense experience through these temporary placements. And secondly, the work experience gained can help them land  their dream jobs as most recruiters prefer people having some experience. For example, many engineering colleges in India have made it compulsory for their students to undergo two months of internship which benefits them in achieving their dream career.

What is your opinion?,"With the advancement of artificial intelligence, there are many people who advocate that humanoid robots can replace completely humans. Indeed, it might a trend in the contemporary day; however, I believe that some jobs are still requested for real people.  This essay will discuss compelling examples to sustain my belief. <NL><NL><NL><NL>There is no doubt that Ai can do numerous works. Because of deep learning and AI algorithms, computer and robots can apply repetitive and simple work, such as manufacturing and accounting. Take factories for example. Through precision computer science, AI might improve effectiveness, accuracy, and productivity compared with what traditional laborers did in the manufactory. Also, AI workers will work for their employers without asking for rest. It is significant to accelerate the productivity and the quality of production. <NL><NL><NL><NL>On the other hand, AI might not take over some intricate jobs which are required for human judgment and experience.  For example, some medical procedures should be operated by skilled surgeons. It is because complex surgeries are crucial and are related to legal issues. Thus, human surgeons should take responsibility for medical decisions instead of AI robots.

Many experts contend that over the next 10 years, robots will take over the jobs in many industries, which are currently done by people. To my way of thinking, there are both pros and cons to this proposal in equal measure. <NL><NL><NL><NL>There are many advantages, if you ask me, to this situation. In the first place, it increases work productivity at the workplace. Machines can work much longer hours than human employees without taking breaks. Their result is much more efficient and far more accurate than employees. People may make mistakes at work, but machines do not. Added to this, they do not have to be paid. Some occasional repairs are may be required over the long periods.  This saves a great amount of money for businesses. For instance, many supermarkets in many countries use automatic customer check-out points, which avoid hiring many workers. <NL><NL><NL><NL>Be that as it may, the downsides of this phenomenon, if you ask me, are just as big. For one thing, it raises the unemployment rate. People who lose jobs because of this will have no income and therefore no money to spend. This could cause serious consequences for the economy. To name but one example, governments cannot get taxes from individuals. As a result of this, governments do not have enough funds for schools, hospitals, public transport and many other facilities and infrastructure. It follows to stand, therefore, that the quality of all essential services will suffer. <NL><NL><NL><NL>Turning to my own experience, the way things are when it comes to this issue in my country, China, is the same as it was across the world over.

This is because men have been jacked up the scores for a long time, and this is not because women inferior to man.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Another reason why I believe the government have better observe high-level positions for females is that society needs legal force. In general, managing positions are dominated by men in Japan. As a result, women struggle to be promoted and become executives.

Hence, it is easier to direct gender equality for companies when the government set a rule.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To conclude, I reiterate my complete agreement with the topic.

For instance, Labour delivery in hospitals must and should be done by doctors, because of complications at times, that need to implement on the spot which only comes with experience. However, robots with programme implanted might not be the better option. Secondly, not only this, we have few more cases where mechanisation fail if replaced.

Men still seem to outnumber the women in terms of employment in tech business. In this essay I shall discuss the issues tossed against women in securing these jobs and changes that need to be put forth to reduce this inequality. <NL><NL><NL><NL>Regardless of having equal or superior skills to their male counterpart, women often feel societal pressure and cultural norms work against them while seeking jobs. Interviewers question the female applicants about their martial and parental status to understand their personal commitments before offering them the job, hence women are pushed to carefully guard their details in an interview, so they don’t lose out on the job. Additionally, not having a collage degree or computer science graduation tend to lower their confidence at workplace or when applying for jobs, because in many cultures’ families encourage men to pursue higher education while women are pushed performed household activities. For instances in Asian countries people believe that men are bread winners of the family as well as invest in their education but on the other hand women are taught to take care of the home and perform domestic work. All these factors make the career path of a woman more challenging.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Many women activist across the globe have brought up this issue to the society and fought gender equality in job market. As result of this, today many corporate companies incorporated polices to ensure their work force have equal number of women and men employee. Other than this IT sector need diligently transform their corporate culture to respect all employees, moreover make discrimination and gender inequality socially unacceptable. These changes will make the womenfolk feel more secure and boost their morality, thus we can perhaps close the gap between gender disparity.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To conclude, cultural norms need to change in employment and educational settings to permanently eliminate the problem of gender discrimination, so every woman can feel confident, supported and safe as they pursue their dreams.",4.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.942790,0,hf

This essay will discuss why eventually only very few jobs will be carried out by people.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Robots may eventually replace all human labour that does not require specific and complex human skills. Many companies will turn to artificial intelligence because it is far less expensive than hiring, training and employing a human.

In addition, these automated stations work around the clock and require no holidays or holiday pay. For these reasons, jobs that can be replaced by robotic intelligence will be replaced.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Conversely, there are some human jobs that cannot be replaced because robots will never achieve the capacity to do them.

This essay completely agrees with the statement because this will save quite an amount of resources for the companies and moreover, it is comfortable for the employees.<NL><NL>To begin with, many companies will allow their employees to work from home. In almost all multinational companies, majority of work is done on the computers online contrary to the work done in the past which was done manually. Work like attending meeting, presentations and conversation with the clients can be easily done with the help of internet and it is not mandatory to go to the office. This saves huge amount of money with regards to paying rents, electricity bill and other running cost. A study performed on America’s largest company has proven that there is no significance difference between the efficacy from working in the office and from home along with positive impact on company’s balance sheet.<NL><NL>Secondly, it is very convenient for the employees to works from home. Going to the office and travelling long distance drains lot of energy and is very tiring and this negatively affect the overall performance. This can be negated by staying home and working in homely and comfortable environment. Several researches have shown that employees who are working from home have fewer health problems and less family issues as compared to the regular employees.<NL><NL>To summarize, in coming years home will be the new office in order to provide much needed relaxation to companies increasing expenditures as well as to the employees",4.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.942849,0,hf

While some still hold to the conservative view that certain jobs are better performed by men and others by women, it is my personal belief that people of their sex are capable of doing any job effectively. The reasons for my position are as follows.<NL><NL>First of all, I believe it is a mistake to base our views on broad generalisations about the characteristics of men and women as such stereotypes are often inaccurate. Although there are certainly traits which are typical of men and others which are typical of women, there are exceptions to every rule. Not all women are physically weak, just as not all men are poor interpersonal communicators; conventional gender roles are not appropriate for everybody. If a man and woman desires to pursue a career which is traditionally reserved for the opposite sex, I believe he/ she should be provided the opportunity to prove him/ herself capable.<NL><NL>Secondly, I would contend that the presence of both males and females in a workplace brings a sense of balance. Men and women frequently, though by no means always, have different methods of doing things. Rather than judging these differences to be weakness, I feel that we should view them as opportunities for innovation and the discovery of more effective and efficient work practices. A person’s weakness can thus be transformed into strengths.<NL><NL>In summary, I once again reaffirm my position that both male and female employees are an asset to any industry and as our stereotypes about men and women are not always appropriate, we must not discourage anyone from choosing an occupation simply because of his/ her gender.",6.0,2024-11-25 18:05:38.942862,0,hf

What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion, should be done about it?","When young people are choosing what subject to study at university, most of them hope they will find a great job upon graduation. In reality many fresh graduates fail to find work in their field and some are even forced to take up a below graduate level job. In my opinion, the root of this problem lies in the outdated higher education system that should be modernized.<NL>Traditional university education does not prepare students for their first job for a number of reasons. One of them is that many programmes are too theoretical. It means that highly educated graduates lack simple skills required for employment, for example, the knowledge of IT software. Employers, therefore, prefer candidates with hands-on experience. Another reason is that universities offer too many courses in popular fields, such as business and law, and do not recruit enough students for engineering and science programmes. As a result, the UK labour market has an oversupply of law graduates and a deficit of engineers. <NL>A reform of higher education could alleviate many of the problems but would require joint efforts from universities and the government. If universities worked closer with employers, they could teach students practical skills that companies look for. Meanwhile, the government could develop guidelines on how many students universities should recruit in each subject in accordance with the market demand.<NL>In conclusion, a likely reason why many graduates cannot find a job in their field is because university education might not have provided them with the right skill set or an in-demand profession. I think that universities and the government could improve the situation by updating the content of the programmes and limiting the number of students in each subject in line with the market demand.",5.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.942875,0,hf

While I accept that luck does have an important role in helping people reach their targets, I would argue that hard work and determination are much more crucial factors leading to the achievement of an individual. <NL><NL><NL><NL>On the one hand, I agree that luck can be an important factor. First, some people are fortunate enough to be born in a wealthy family, which allows them to have a better education or to easily start their own business without having to borrow money from someone else.

Having an ever-growing demand for land to live and wood to consume, humans decide on deforestation to serve their purpose. Therefore, it leads to flora and fauna being indiscriminately destroyed and lost completely instead of being replaced and it pushes many categories of species on the verge of extinction.  For example, Panda is China’s national treasure, but this species is on the brink of extinction because of deforestation. There is a wealth of animals in the world that are dying out because of human activities, which is the reason people doubt that it is too late to tackle the problem. <NL><NL><NL><NL> While the redeeming features of negative effects of human activities on flora and fauna species are widely acknowledged, we will find an address in order to enhance the issue.

Some argue that preventing extinction is not necessary, as it is a natural process. However, I believe that humans have a moral obligation to protect endangered species and prevent their extinction.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Firstly, human activities such as deforestation, overfishing, and pollution have caused a rapid decline in animal populations, leading many species to be at risk of extinction. As a result, humans have a responsibility to conserve the environment and prevent further harm to wildlife. It is unfair for humans to cause the extinction of a species due to their actions, particularly when they have the ability to prevent it.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Another reason is that many species play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem. For example, bees are essential pollinators that are responsible for pollinating 80% of flowering plants, and thus if bees were to become extinct, it would have a devastating impact on our food supply and ecosystem. Similarly, the loss of predators can cause a ripple effect, leading to overpopulation of other species and causing imbalances in the food chain.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Lastly, preventing extinction is not only a matter of responsibility but also a matter of morality. Species have intrinsic value, and it is not our place to determine which species should exist and which should not. Humans must respect the inherent value of all life forms and do what they can to protect them.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, while extinction may be a natural process, it is not a justification for humans to sit idly by and watch as countless species go extinct.

As a result, they can be productive in their other subjects.

Students learn about their country's history, culture, and traditions. For example, a country like India has diverse cultures and traditions it is important for the citizen to have knowledge of their country when they move to different parts that will help to a certain extent.

Recently, many big issues have happened all around the world. Especially, the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia is very sad news for everyone. I personally believe that students need to learn about what is going on outside of their countries during school time. This essay discusses the advantages and disadvantages of creating such a subject at secondary schools and my opinion will be provided. <NL><NL><NL><NL> I opine that international news classes are essential for the following reason. Learning about the topic associated with other countries leads students to expanding their perspectives. To illustrate, an international school in Tokyo where students come from various countries originally have a unique class in which kids take one topic and discuss it from a a cultural and regional point of view. As a result, students can get different ways of thinking and one of the graduates becomes the CEO of the biggest IT company. Exposure to contemporary affairs from a young age makes them become global citizens who are needed to think of things from a variety of perspectives.<NL><NL><NL><NL>On the other hand, it has a negative aspect as well. A potential disadvantage of this subject is that overseas affairs sometimes contain strong political and religious aspects. Education for kids is supposed to be away from politics and religion because they might affect who they are. For example, children in Iran, where they are taught to be soldiers at school, believe what is taught, therefore they  are fighting as a soldier without any doubt. Hence, global news including such things might affect who they are.<NL><NL><NL><NL> In conclusion, I believe that the advantages of learning about international news as one of the subjects outweigh the drawbacks that it might bring. I suggest that secondary schools should set such a subject in a curriculum in order to make students exposed to various issues in the world, however, educators need to be careful about the negative aspect.",6.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.943812,0,hf

This is because nowadays social media and television are full of advertisements related to unhealthy food options. So, if a child is aware of food science and how nutritious food would keep their body fit, that would encourage them to choose correct food habits. In addition, cooking is a necessity and should be taught to everyone. The curriculum should have a subject such as home science where students can be taught how to prepare their own food. It would motivate them to indulge themselves in home-cooked food instead of spending money on junk food available in markets.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Others who think school days should be used for learning important subjects such as maths and science would argue that these subjects help students in making successful careers later in life. Moreover, in their view, teaching students to learn cooking would distract them from the main subjects. This might lead to students performing poorly in important career-making subjects. However, in today’s time when childhood obesity is being very common, incorporating food science as a subject in the school curriculum might help in curbing this issue.

By participating in art activities, children deploy a wide range of accomplishments, like decision-making, thereby enhancing them.

This essay will discuss both the views by demonstrating facts and points.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To begin with, it is very important to protect the environment from getting polluted. For this, schools can introduce a compulsory subject of waste management in the curriculum. Therefore, children will learn more about it as dedicated time slot will be allocated for exploring this issue. Moreover, children will get hands-on experience and practical knowledge too. It is evident that cognition and intellectual skills are developed more by performing group activities. Peers play a vital role in encouraging and inculcating interest in things which aloof individual finds hard to incur. So, school can act as a channel to motivate its students in reducing the misuse.<NL><NL><NL><NL>On the other hand, kids at home imitate what their parents do.

One realistically cogent reason is that art is not an essential skill for life survival. People still can find a job and earn for living without an art talent.

Although i consider that this might be an effective measure, i believe that other measures have even more profound impacts. <NL><NL><NL>On the one hand, there are a variety of reasons why increasing the fuel prices is beneficial in addressing some of the environmental problems . Firstly, in terms of private cars, when the national authorities raise the taxes on petrol, motorists will have to limit the time and length of their journey. Therefore, governments will have more money to reinforce and update the public transport provision, as people still need to go the office, school or other medical health services like hospital, for example. Secondly, from the perspective of the freight services, more goods are transported by rail instead of truck.

In turn, there is a general decline in exhaust fumes from vehicles around the city centre and the air quality in the city has improved by this action.

To what extent do you agree or disagree  with this statement?,"Over the past decades, environmental problems have never failed to draw public attention  and provoke debates. Although the severity and urgency of addressing environmental  problems properly are hardly arguable, the issue as to whether governments should deal with  these issues with higher price of fuels or not remains controversial. From my own perspective,  I consider this approach is ineffective.  Firstly, it is important to recognize that although the occurrence of positive outcome towards environment is almost inevitable, the final result may not be as expected for long. Some may  hold optimistic attitude that this particular approach would be the effect on limiting the  number of cars and thereby reducing the amount of environment-damaging gas emission. This  argument could be true to some extent. However, they should take into account the fact that  since the cost of public transport would also be affected, resistance in people with the need of  travel seems to be inevitable, hence the impossibility of achieving the desired goal. Therefore,  increasing fuel prices will not make any significant changes.  Secondly, it is equally important to recognize that there is evidence that waste gas from cars is  not the leading cause of air pollution. The opponents may argue that the combustion of fossil  fuels by cars is the main producer of carbon dioxide. Nevertheless, they are ignorant of the fact  that the chef culprit is the discharge of pollutants into the atmosphere due to the rapidly growing  manufacturing industry. Governments could better handle this problem if they could increase  control over industrial waste-discharge and adopt more environmental friendly materials and  production equipment. For example, wind and tidal power in the Netherlands, nuclear power in  Japan and solar power in the United States have all proven their efficiency  in energy  production. This example indicates that other solutions could be employed in other parts of the  world to minimize the global dependence on fossil fuel.  In conclusion, under no circumstances should increasing the price of fuels be taken as the best  solution to environmental issues, as it has neglected both the reaction of consumers and the  root cause of the problem as mentioned above.",4.0,2024-11-25 18:05:38.944110,0,hf

While I consider that this might be an effective measure, I would argue that other measures might have an even greater impact.<NL>On the one hand, raising the cost of fuel for cars and other modes is one of the efficient way because of some reasons. Firstly, higher fuel prices can help to limit the number of car journeys. A large number of low and middle income earners are not able to afford the incease in the cost of petrol, therefore they are forced to adapt to other means of transport such as: bicycle, walking, train, bus, etc. Traveling by public transportation instead private cars is the necessary way to cut down on car emission and reduce greenhouse effect. Secondly, the extra money, which collected from increasing fuel prices can be used in order to compensate for the extra expense. Government can raise expenditure on upgrading and expand public facilities and transportation to suffice residents. <NL>On the other hand, while this rise in petrol costs might be a useful stopgap measure, national authorities could apply some other solutions to tackle this problem.

Firstly, this essay will discuss on how this decision can reduce the emissions of dangerous gases releasing into the air and secondly, explain how it can decrease the overall consumption of this resource utilized by human beings for industrial purposes.<NL>Increasing the price of fuel can reduce the number of vehicles travelling on the streets. This can prevent in emission of greenhouse gases, particularly from vehicles into the air and as a result, it reduces overall pollution, which is also one of the primary  contributing factors in environmental issues. For example, the United Kingdom has recently surged the prices of the fuel and it resulted in lesser traffic and even showed significant difference in the air quality due to lesser hazardous gases released. Therefore, it is clear that increasing the cost can actually make a difference to tackle this problem.<NL>Another reason to consider inclining the prices of the fuel would directly reflect in the reduction of all other industries using fuel as a primary energy source. In other words, several industries use diesel and gas as a primary source of energy to provide electricity to their machines and now people will double check on spending hefty amounts which will eventually reduce the excess consumption of this resource and therefore look for renewable ways to run their machines. It is therefore playing a prominent role in tackling the contributing factors of environmental problems. Hence, it is patently evident that hiking the costs of the fuel is beneficial to the society.<NL>In conclusion, surging the prices of the fuel can tackle environmental problems as it reduces the vehicles that emit gasses into the atmosphere and overall reduction of its consumption which are powering up machines.

I believe to some extent both ideas are correct and the right way is to utilize both ideas at the same time.<NL><NL><NL><NL>On the one hand, a proportion of people agree schools have to provide both educational and vocational curricula for students to provide the nation with citizens who will behave based on the predefined rules and act proactively in the industry as employees. For example, these days, elementary school pupils are encouraged to join different extra-time classes including sports, dance, science or vocational.<NL><NL><NL><NL>On the other hand, there is an idea against the aforementioned belief which says if kids require to know their mental and physical characteristics first, then they will figure out their talents easily. This idea points  out that playtime is a must-have for children at school and they need to play with other counterparts in school to learn the concept of teamwork naturally. Therefore, they will learn to obey the law and be productive by doing social activities.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In general, there are two hypotheses about the responsibility of schools to nurture students. The first one knows schools are responsible for preparing useful employees and citizens, but the second one mentions children only need to take benefits from schools individually. Although schools have to focus on the personal growth of each child, they need to prepare them for their future professional life as children are the most valuable asset of each nation.",6.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.944271,0,hf

For my perspective, both of distraction and education sides shoud be encouraged in museums.<NL>On the one hand, museums should be play in the entertainment role for some reasons. Firstly, lots of people are likely to go somewhere in weekends to let their hair down after hard working days. They want to look for a transquil place to contemplate the beauty of life or artworks and museums are such appropriate sites. Secondly, museums are destinations for tourist attractions, where a country may advertise its regional or national culture or history. Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate the interacted activities or funny games into museum trips so that visitors do not feel boring and find it easy to remember the knowledge provided by the guides. <NL>On the other hand, museums should teach people about many aspect of life, such as history, science, art, culture and so on. Almost every city in one country possess at least one museum to serve local people and tourists. Hence, professional guides of museums have to either explain visitors whatever about the historical stories or origin of relics attached to locality or distribute to visitors pictures or audio documentary so that they understand well about details of one exhibition. Schools and colleges also usually organise museum trips where pupils or students are more eager to learn or verify the reality through visual sightseeings. <NL>In conclusion, it seems to me that learning from the practical observation and combined games is more interesting than tough theorical lessons.

This essay will give several factors that why this happened and will give some suggestions to solve this problem.<NL><NL><NL><NL>The first reason why people changed their job frequently is due to the job market nowadays is much better than it was in the past. Now, there are more jobs for people to choose from in the job market than in the old times. So people will have more chances to join  a new position in the same field or switch to a completely new field due to  society's development.<NL><NL><NL><NL>The second reason is that the cost for people to live  a decent life costs much more than it  used to.

People have a way to find what they are interested in and the internet helps people  learn new knowledge or technology easily. It provides a convenient way for people to switch their jobs. It also causes people  not to stay in one position for a long time.<NL><NL><NL><NL>But this phenomenon may do a little harm to the company because it may lose some expertise employees and if they want to hire  new employees with the same quality, it requires them to pay more salaries to them, which may influence the company's development and profits. So there should have some measures to alleviate this phenomenon happened. The company could provide a clear path for employees to get promoted and give some employees who perform well a good bonus. It will  make employees feel safe and satisfied. What's more, a good work-life balance is also a key factor to reduce the leaving rate for employees.",5.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.944839,0,hf

In the city many people expect to find better employment opportunities, often with bigger, secure companies. as cities become overcrowded, problems relating to housing and transport arise, because of which some people suggest that the larger companies should relocate to the countryside. while this may have some advantages, i firmly believe that the disadvantages would be far more than the advantages. <NL><NL><NL><NL>It is reasonable to think that moving thousands of employees from large companies out to remote areas would have a positive impact on the overcrowding of some cities. there would be less traffic because of less strain on the services offered by the city-bank, public transportation, restaurants and the like. This would mean a reduction in queues and faster customer service. To add to it, housing would also become affordable. It is generally seen that because of too many people wanting to live in the city, land prices and event rents of houses start touching the sky.<NL><NL><NL><NL>the problem however would be that a dramatic reduction in numbers of people in the cities would mean that many businesses would go broke. Restaurants, cafes and other service areas would suffer tremendously. What would happen is that overcrowding would occur where the new, large organizations relocate. More and more people offering services would spring up- restaurants, shopping centers and other businesses would be needed to serve the increasingly larger numbers of people who moved to the area. in addition, the rural area may not be able to provide the enormous quantities of housing, electricity and raw materials required to run a huge company. <NL><NL><NL><NL>Furthermore, relocating businesses to rural areas may upset many households. Children also may have to change schools. so It would not be practical to do so. Transport and accommodation problems in cities need to be sorted out by connecting the villages and cities by very efficient public transport, so that people come to work in cities and live in rural areas. Newer businesses should be encouraged to open in the suburbs; the already existing ones should continue to be where they already are. <NL><NL><NL><NL>To sum up, relocating the companies would assist with the overcrowding problem in some cities. However, a new set of problems would surface, which would be far more than the benefits. Therefore, I reiterate my point that the idea of moving larger corporations out to rural areas would not be beneficial.",5.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.944857,0,hf

Repeated reports led the surviving children to recall the exceptionally painful experience. They had to live under an intense psychological pressure. Secondly, too many details in crime news allow people attempting to commit crime to learn the criminal methods and consequently increasing the crime rate.

Secondly, caring about the social impacts of a business sometimes affects the income of a factory as well.

I largely agree with this point and I will outline my reasons in this essay.<NL><NL><NL><NL>There are other factors which accompany the purpose of making money that promotes companies in long term.Social responsibilities have played a crucial role to hold businesses in their paths.To name an exquisite example , there were companies which produced plastics. Although they reached the niche of becoming prosperous , it was only for a short time Because as people figured out the disadvantage of plastics that harms the environment due to incapability to recycle , most people refused to buy them and those businesses have become faded in long term.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In most developed countries , government determine obligation for businesses in terms of social responsibility such as environmental responsibility by establishing taxes and allocating budget for campaigns to observe the function of businesses.

338398348536922137,"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is true that businesses need to make a profit in order to not declare bankruptcy. Some people have opinions about whether businesses should have public responsibilities. From my perspective, I totally agree with the statement.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To begin with, it seems logical that businesses must make a profit in order to cover their overhead cost. Without profiting from their business, companies might not be able to cover their running costs, such as employees’ salaries, facilities, and payments for the building. As a result, companies might declare bankruptcy, and end up closing down their businesses. Another argument is that without making profits, businesses might not be able to fulfil their social responsibilities. This is because when businesses can not cover their running cost or fulfil customers’ demands, any social concerns might be neglected. In other words, less attention might be paid to public concern, simply because this is not businesses’ main purpose. This means if a business is not in good financial health, it might not be able to fulfil public concerns. <NL><NL><NL><NL>On the other hand, businesses should also fulfil their public responsibilities, instead of focusing on the sole purpose of maximising their profits. Firstly, one social concern that is associated with managers and businesses is to treat their employees well. Treating employees right might provide them with the comfortability needed to improve their work efficiency, boosting the country’s economy. Lastly, I believe that companies should stop abusing accounting loopholes to minimise their taxes. Paying taxes is an essential part of businesses’ social responsibility. Instead of using accounting loopholes to avoid taxes, companies should happily pay taxes to contribute to society. <NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, it is logical that companies must make a profit to not go bankrupt, however, they should still fulfil public responsibilities instead of focusing on maximising profit.",7.0,2024-11-25 18:05:38.945084,0,hf

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Although earning money is one of the most important factors when people conduct business, those who run companies should take social responsibility. In my opinion, while generating profit is the top priority for each company, I agree that firms should have the responsibility to society.<NL><NL><NL><NL>There are many reasons why firms should allocate resources to help the community. Firstly, this may help companies promote their public image and increase their sales figures. For example, big corporations such as Vinamilk and FPT should have philanthropic activities such as providing scholarships and giving charitable donations to help those who are less fortunate. Secondly, production processes may lead to serious environmental degradation such as pollution and global warming stemming from factory emissions and the irresponsible disposal of chemical waste. Thus, firms should spend their income installing waste treatment systems and solving these environmental issues along with the governments.<NL><NL><NL><NL>However, The efforts of businesses to earn their profits may bring some tangible benefits to society. The first reason is that they have the opportunity to expand their businesses thanks to their income. So, this creates new job opportunities for workers and reduces crime in many countries. Another reason is that the more money companies earn, the more taxes they pay to the government. As a result, authorities can have more revenue to spend in key fields such as education, health care, and transportation. So, this contributes to improving the quality of life of local communities.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, although I recognize that increasing profits is the fundamental principle of business, I would argue that all companies should be responsible for society.",7.5,2024-11-25 18:05:38.945116,0,hf

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","IIt is argued by many people that companies have necessary communal duties in addition to making a profit, while others claims that making profit  is the fundamental aspect for them so they can  focus only their gains.<NL><NL><NL>To begin with, companies budget is restricted so they cannot allocate funds to social investments. To demonstrate, many firms prefer to invest their limited funds to infrastructures for their companies such as new production systems, education for their workers. In 2012,  I worked in a company and this firm has a chance to construct a fitness centre for workers, these place probable increased labor’s  motivations, while firm owner preferred to buy a new machine for production.  Without doubt, this company  was eager to  allacote funds for public awareness due to this machine was capable for gain more income than personal’s motivation.<NL><NL>In addition, many companies are prone to social developments. To illustrates, if citizens adjusted better life conditions, they would want to new social opportunities. Without doubt, no firm does not jeopardize their system. According to Hans Brigel, a history professor at Cambridge University, Ottoman Empire’s economy system was collapsed due to globalization. As can be predicted, many labour heard new gadgets, high-quality fabric, especially coffee. Price of the coffee was excess to an Ottoman worker’s monthly salary so citizens wanted an improvement at their income. This improvements affected the budget of the government. Finally, Ottoman’s treasure went to the debt due to personal’s wages.<NL><NL>Finally, some business is eager to allocate a budget for the public duty due to their marketing strategy. To demonstrate, these companies gain customers with their social investments. Kellogs, one of the biggest cereal producers in the world, they invest %20 of their income to UNICEF and Red Cross so they  gained customer’s sympathies. As stated by an observation company that they observed 100.000 people who ate one cup of Kellogs cornflakes in their breakfast. Surprisingly, %70 of them preferred to Kellogs due to their social supports.<NL><NL>In conclusion,  social awareness is not compulsory for firms, because paying their labour’s wage and making profits are  their crucial duties so they cannot jeopardize their budget for the communities benefits.",5.0,2024-11-25 18:05:38.945137,0,hf

31106195744806702,"Nations should spend more money on skills and vocational training for practical work, rather than on university education.<NL><NL><NL><NL>To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Many today feel that countries should prioritise vocational training over higher education due to changes in the labour market. In my opinion, though there are strong economic reasons to support this idea, university education holds greater value.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Those in favour of more practical skills training point out the financial benefits. Most university graduates are burdened with student debt and face uncertain job prospects. In contrast, training schools are cheap, fast, and ease students into steady employment immediately. The jobs they train for are also most likely recession-proof and durable, including positions as cooks, hotel managers, and skilled technicians. Someone who is firmly established in such a job in their early 20s does not have to deal with the pressure associated with university life and its incumbent debts. Instead, they can begin to set aside money for a house or start a family.<NL><NL><NL><NL>Nonetheless, lacking a university degree limit one's options. The jobs available will pay well initially and be secure, but offer narrow scope for advancement and virtually no opportunity to switch the career paths. An individual with a university degree, on the other hand, might begin from a lower position, but has a higher ceiling on future earnings. It is also possible for them to explore a variety of fields. Most good jobs require at least a bachelor’s degree even for simple internship vacancies. Lacking such a degree, means restricting oneself to manual labour or service industry jobs. The actual learning that takes place at university, particularly for those with multi skills majors or studying at liberal art schools, also encourages students to consider a wide range of possible career options.<NL><NL><NL><NL>In conclusion, increasing funding for vocational training is an attractive yet short sighted approach that curbs possibilities.
